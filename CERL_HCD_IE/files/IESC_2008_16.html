<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Judgment of Mr Justice Finnegan delivered the 10th day of April 2008 </font></b>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	The appellant applied to the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal on the 24th June 2003 pursuant to the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act 1997 section 4(1)(d) as amended by the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal (Amendment) Act 2002 section 4(a)(1)(i) in respect of financial loss or expenses incurred or to be incurred by him in the care of AF his wife who had contracted Hepatitis C.  On the 27th October 2004 the Tribunal declined to make an award to him on the basis that on the 18th December 1997 an award had been made to him under section 4(1)(d) of the 1997 Act for financial loss or expenses to date and into the future.  The appellant appealed the decision of the Tribunal to the High Court.  On the 5th May 2005 the High Court (Hanna J.) dismissed the appeal.  On the 25th May 2005 the High Court (Hanna J.) pursuant to section 5(19) of the 1997 Act gave the appellant leave to appeal that decision to the Supreme Court on the following specified questions of law:-</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">1.	Was the court correct in refusing the appellant financial loss and expense incurred as a direct result of providing care pursuant to section 4(1)(d) of the 1997 Act as amended by the 2002 Act.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2.	If a claimant has recovered financial loss and expense under section 4(1)(d) of the 1997 Act is he entitled to pursue a claim for financial loss and expense under section 4(1)(d) of the 1997 Act (as amended) in respect of financial loss and expense which was not contemplated in the previous application.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3.	Was the court correct in finding that the Tribunal&#8217;s award of special damages to the claimant in 1997 acts as a bar to a future claim for special damages despite the court&#8217;s acceptance that there was a significant transformation in the claimant&#8217;s circumstances.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">4.	Was the court entitled to exercise its discretion pursuant to the Supreme Court decision of </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fitzgerald v Kenny</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1994] 2 I.R. 383 and award a claim for financial loss and expense pursuant to section 4(1)(d) of the 1997 Act as amended by the 2002 Act.</font></ul>
</ul>
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Proceedings before the Tribunal</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	On the 18th December 1997 the appellant&#8217;s wife A.F. made a claim for compensation to the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal having contracted Hepatitis C following the administration of contaminated anti-d immunoglobulin.  The appellant made a separate claim to the Tribunal pursuant to the provisions of the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act 1997 (&#8220;the 1997 Act&#8221;) section 4(1)(d) which provides as follows:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;4(1)	The following persons may make a claim for compensation to the Tribunal &#8211;</font></i>
<p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">(d)	any person who is responsible for the care of a person referred to in paragraph (a), (b) or (c), who has incurred financial loss or expenses as a direct result of providing such care arising from the person being cared for having contracted Hepatitis C.&#8221;</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	The claim related to loss of earnings as a result of time off work bringing A.F. to and from medical appointments.  The appellant&#8217;s application was heard on the same day and immediately after the hearing of the application of A.F.  The appellant&#8217;s evidence was that he did not anticipate &#8216;any detriment&#8217; in the future and although afforded the opportunity to do so did not wish to have his hearing postponed.  The evidence on the application of A.F. was of a probability that over the next five years she would develop increasing fibrosis and cirrhosis with the possibility of developing decompensated cirrhosis.  The Tribunal made a provisional award to A.F. on the basis that if she developed decompensated cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma she would be at liberty to return to the Tribunal for further compensation.  In relation to the appellant the Tribunal made a final award in the following terms:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">	&#8220;We are satisfied that as a result of the necessity for Mr F. to take his wife, who has contracted Hepatitis C, to and from various doctors for medical consultations arising directly as a result of her hepatic condition that he has incurred and will in the future incur loss of earnings.  Accordingly we allow the sum of £&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;to Mr F. and this is a final award.&#8221;</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	While section 4(1)(d) of the 1997 Act refers to a person &#8220;who has incurred financial loss or expenses&#8221; it was held in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">D.R. v Minister for Health and Children</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (unreported) The High Court 19th January 2001 O&#8217;Neill J. that the Tribunal could make an award for future as well as past financial loss or expenses.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	Between 1997 and October 2004 the health of A.F. deteriorated significantly and led to a change in the circumstances of the appellant.  He gave up his employment to care for A.F. in September 2000.  The Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal (Amendment) Act 2002 (&#8220;the 2002 Act&#8221;) amended the 1997 Act.  Section 4(1) was amended as follows:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">1.	Section 4(1)(d) was amended by inserting after the words &#8216;who has incurred&#8217; the words &#8216;or will incur&#8217;.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2.	The categories of persons entitled to make claims was extended and relevant here is the additional category inserted into the 1997 Act at section 4(1)(d):-</font>
<p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">	&#8220;(h)	Any person who is married to a person referred to in paragraph (a),(b) or (f), or who has been living with a person referred to in paragraph (a), (b) or (f) for a continuous period of not less than three years, in respect of the consortium of the person, including impairment of sexual relations with the person, arising from the risk of transmission of Hepatitis C or HIV&#8221;</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	Relying on these amendments on the 25th June 2003 the appellant applied to the Tribunal making a claim for compensation under section 4(1)(d) and (h).  On the 24th October 2004 the Tribunal made an award pursuant to section 4(1)(h) to the appellant.  The Tribunal refused to make an award to the appellant under section 4(1)(d).  In so doing it had regard to the provisions of section 4(9)(a) of the 1997 Act which provides as follows:</font>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">	&#8220;(9)(a)  Subject to subsection (13), where the Tribunal makes an award to a claimant the claimant shall have a period of one month or such greater period as may be prescribed from the date of receiving notice of the making of the award during which the claimant may decide in writing either to accept or reject the award or to appeal the award under subsection (15).&#8221;</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	In</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> D.B. v the Minister for Health and Children and The Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (unreported) the Supreme Court 26th March 2003 the facts were as follows.  The respondent made a claim to the Tribunal and on the 4th November 1997 had been awarded compensation.  On the 24th November 1997 he accepted the award in writing.  Notwithstanding this on the 22nd April 1999 the respondent brought a Notice of Motion to appeal the award.  It was held that having accepted the award the respondent lost his right to appeal the same.  In relation to section 4(9)(a) Denham J. had this to say:</font>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">	&#8220;There are three choices and they are put in the form of two main alternatives under the statute.  Claimants may either accept or reject the award.  Alternatively they may appeal the award under subsection (15).  The words are plain and clear.	The claimant must do one of these three alternatives.  If he accepts the award he has taken one of the alternatives and cannot proceed otherwise.  If he rejects the award he has made his choice and may then move into another arena.  If he appeals then he has chosen to stay within the Tribunal Scheme:  he has tribunalised his claim.&#8221;</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	As to the entitlement of a claimant who has accepted an award of the Tribunal Denham J. had this to say:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">	&#8220;As I have answered the first question affirmatively, the second question does not require a decision.  However, for the sake of completeness, I am satisfied that, as is apparent from the construction of the section set out previously in this judgment, applying the same construction of the section results in an affirmative answer to the question.  As stated previously, under the Statutory Scheme the claimant has three choices after an award is made.  These choices are in the alternative.  These choices had to be made within the mandatory timeframe.  The choices are to accept or reject the award.  Or, alternatively to appeal the award.  Consequently a claimant who has accepted an award of the Tribunal is barred from appealing the award.  As the claimant accepted the award in this case he is barred from appealing the award.&#8221; </font></i></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	The Tribunal took the view that the appellant having received an award in respect of past and future financial loss or expenses and accepted the same it had no power to make a further award.  Having regard to the decision of the High Court in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">D.R. v The Minister for Health and Children</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> unreported the High Court (19th January 2001) O&#8217;Neill J. the Tribunal was satisfied that it was within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to make an award for future financial loss and expenses on the 18th December 1997.  A further claim for financial loss and expenses could not be entertained.  The respondent appealed to the High Court.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The decision of the High Court</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	The respondent&#8217;s notice of motion by way of appeal sought an award by way of an appeal pursuant to section 5(15) of the 1997 Act to the claimant in such amount as the court should see fit by way of compensation for future loss including future loss of earnings pursuant to section 4(1)(d) of the Act.  The appellant submitted that the amendment of section 4(1)(d) by the insertion into the same of the words &#8220;or will incur&#8221; by the 2002 Act created a fresh ground upon which he can apply to the Tribunal.   The time limit for such a claim is that provided in section 4(14) of the 1997 Act, namely within the period of three years of the date upon which she or he first began to incur such financial loss or expenses or the establishment day whichever is the later and the appellant applied within that time.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	In the alternative the appellant relied on the decision of this court in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fitzgerald v Kenny</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> 1994 2 I.R. 383.  In that case the plaintiff had been awarded damages for personal injuries against the defendant and had appealed against the quantum of general damages awarded.  He subsequently sought to amend his notice of appeal to include an appeal against the award of future loss of earnings and to introduce evidence of the following:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">(i)	The loss of his job, four years after the trial, on medical grounds the possibility of his losing his job not having been raised at the hearing.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii)	The deterioration of an arm injury subsequent to the trial.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iii)	Severe depressive illness relating to his injuries, psychiatric evidence having been adduced at the trial.  </font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	The Supreme Court permitted an amendment of the notice of appeal and permitted further evidence to be adduced.  It was held that the loss by the plaintiff of his job was a new matter which had arisen after the trial, so that special leave to give evidence thereof was not required, although the court had to exercise a discretion as to whether such evidence should be given and that this discretion must be exercised in a fair and just manner and that each case in which the exercise of the discretion is sought must be approached in relation to its own facts.  The court had regard to the provisions of the Rules of the Superior Courts, order 58, rule 8, which provides that further evidence may be given on appeal to the Supreme Court without special leave in any case as to matters which have occurred after the date of the decision from which the appeal is brought.  The loss of the appellant&#8217;s job was something which had occurred after the trial and accordingly without leave of the court evidence in relation to the same could be received.  In the course of his judgment O&#8217;Flaherty J. at p.389 said:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;If the evidence sought to be adduced was confined to the problem of the plaintiff&#8217;s left arm turning out to be much worse than was anticipated by the learned trial judge, and the matter of a psychiatric deterioration (it should be noted that psychiatric evidence was given on his behalf by Dr. David Dunne at the trial), I apprehend that there might be difficulties in the way of receiving such evidence.</font></i>
<p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">	In</font></i><b><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Dalton v the Minister for Finance</font></i></b><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1989] I.R. 269 at p.273 Finlay C.J.    speaking for the courts said:-</font></i>
<ul><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8216;With particular regard to the assessment of damages for personal injuries, it is clear that very many plaintiffs may feel after the conclusion of their case and with the passage of years in reflecting upon the matter that they have been inadequately compensated.  Many defendants may equally be of the impression, seeing the plaintiff, if they happen to do so, moving around and apparently being able to cope with life that the plaintiff has been exorbitantly compensated.  To allow either of these two categories of persons subsequently to seek a variation of the assessment of damages based on after events would be to cut across the entire finality of litigation in this context.&#8217;</font></i></ul>
<br>
<i><font size="2" face="Verdana">	Dalton v The Minister for Finance was essentially an application to extend the time to appeal the damages award, nearly two years after the verdict, and the case was concerned with whether the conditions laid down in </font></i><b><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Eire Continental Trading Company Limited v Clonmel Foods Limited</font></i></b><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1955] I.R. 170 for granting such an extension are being satisfied.  The court held that, as far as two of the conditions were concerned, they had not been satisfied.  It was also a case that was confined to a suggestion of deterioration in physical condition which had existed at the date of trial.</font></i>
<p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">	It seems to me, however, that the problem that we have to resolve in this application is presented in a more stark format.  It is true that there should, as far as possible, be finality in litigation and therefore the decision as to whether to admit fresh evidence on appeal must always be one to be approached with great solicitude because if a plaintiff is to be allowed to adduce fresh evidence then, on occasion, the same must apply in favour of a defendant.&#8221;</font></i>
<ul><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">O&#8217;Flaherty J. concluded as follows:-</font></ul>
<br>
<i><font size="2" face="Verdana">	&#8220;However, in my judgment, our essential task is to determine the appeal in accordance with the set of circumstances that prevails when it comes before us.  Accordingly I hold as follows:</font></i>
<ul><br>
<i><font size="2" face="Verdana">(a)	The matter of the plaintiff&#8217;s job and career loss is a completely new factor arising after the trial.</font></i>
<p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">(b)	The evidence in regard to this matter, therefore, is to be approached as not requiring any form of special leave under the relevant rule.</font></i>
<p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">(c)	Nonetheless this court must apply a discretion.  Like any discretion it must be exercised in a fair and just manner though it may be impossible to lay down a general rule that will cover all circumstances.  Each case must be approached as requiring the exercise of the discretion in relation to its facts.  In the circumstances of this case I hold that the possibility that a serious injustice would be suffered by the plaintiff must prevail over the desirability of having finality in litigation.</font></i>
<p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">(d)	I take the opportunity to reiterate the point that this appeal was brought in time.  If the appeal had been out of time I reserve my position on whether </font></i><b><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Dalton v the Minister for Finance</font></i></b><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1989] I.R. 269 would require any re-consideration.</font></i>
<p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">(e)	As regards the evidence of exacerbation of the plaintiff&#8217;s physical injuries and mental condition, if they stood alone I would not allow in this evidence.  But it seems to me that the evidence in this regard is inextricably entwined with the evidence concerning the loss of the plaintiff&#8217;s job and career in the Garda Siochana and so this new evidence should be admitted too.&#8221;</font></i></ul>

<font size="2" face="Verdana">	For the respondent it was submitted that the statutory provisions regulating the Scheme are clear and that having accepted an award which included an award for future financial loss or expenses the appellant could not maintain the present claim.  </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fitzgerald v Kenny</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> related exclusively to the provisions of the Rules of the Superior Court Order 58 Rule 8:  it had no application to the statutory scheme.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	The learned trial judge held that the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is circumscribed by the statutory provisions.  The scheme does not provide for provisional awards other than for persons directly affected by Hepatitis C.  The award to the appellant accordingly was a final award.  He held that section 4(1)(d) inserted by the 2002 Act did not create a new and discrete cause of action but clarified what had been held by O&#8217;Neill J. in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">D.R. v The Minister for Health and Children</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> namely that the 1997 Act enabled the Tribunal on a claim under section 4(1)(d) to make an award for future financial loss or expenses.  He further held that </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fitzgerald v Kenny</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> could have no application to the statutory scheme.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Submissions of the Appellant</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	On behalf of the appellant it is submitted that section 4(1)(d) of the 1997 Act as amended created a new category of claim:  the only limitation on bringing such a claim was the requirement in section 4(14) that application must be made to the Tribunal within the period of three years of the date upon which the claimant first began to incur such financial loss or expenses or the establishment day whichever is the later.  Thus should new claims arise which fall within section 4(1)(d) a claimant may bring a second and indeed further claims to the Tribunal.  Any other interpretation, it is submitted, would be at odds with the spirit of the 2002 Act the intention of which was to broaden the basis upon which claims to the Tribunal might be bought and not to clarify the provisions of the 1997 Act.  Reliance is placed on </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">M.O&#8217;C v Minister for Health</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2002] 1 I.R. 234.  That case concerned the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to award interest.  It was held that on the construction of section 5(1) of the 1997 Act, whether literal or purposive, the Tribunal had such power.  In the course of a judgment Denham J. said:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">	&#8220;Applying a purposive interpretation to section 5(1) of the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act 1997 it is clear that the fundamental purpose of the Act is to compensate the claimants.  Further it is intended that the Tribunal shall make these awards and that an award of the Tribunal shall be made on the same basis as an award of the High Court, calculated by reference to any relevant statutory provisions.  Relevant statutory provisions include the Courts Act 1981.  Consequently it follows that the purpose and intent of the Act is to put the Tribunal in the same position as the High Court in making awards.  It is implicit in the machinery for the making of the award, for its computation on normal tort principles and by the choice afforded to a claimant to proceed with any right of action (section 5(9) to (14)) that, so far as is reasonably possible and certainly so far as amount is concerned, a Tribunal award should be comparable with a judgment of the High Court&#8230;.Therefore the High Court on appeal from the Tribunal, may as it thinks fit, make an order for interest in accordance with the terms of section 22 of the Courts Act 1981 as it has the same jurisdiction as the Tribunal.&#8221;</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	To allow the present claim to proceed would not be in conflict with the principles which govern the measure of damages in the law of tort as the Supreme Court, having regard to the decision in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fitzgerald v Kenn</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">y, may allow a fresh claim on an appeal against an award of damages in the High Court.  Having regard to the foregoing the Tribunal ought to have applied a discretion to admit the appellant&#8217;s claim on the grounds that the appellant&#8217;s situation was completely transformed and that in effect the claim before the Tribunal was a new claim.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Submission of the respondent</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	The respondent submits that the amendment of section 4(1)(d) did not create a new ground under which a claimant could seek compensation.  Rather it clarified the Tribunal&#8217;s jurisdiction on considering a claim under section 4(1)(d) to make an award in respect of future financial loss or expenses.   That the Tribunal already had such power is clear from the decision of the High Court in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">D.R.v The Minister for Health and Children</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">.  The appellant had the opportunity bring the present claim within the claim which he made in December 1997.  At that time it was clear that there was a risk that the health of A.F. might deteriorate and the award to her was made on a provisional basis on that account.  The appellant was afforded an opportunity to consider whether or not he wished to proceed with his claim at that time and determined to proceed.  The scheme makes no provision for provisional awards to persons claiming under section 4(1)(d) but rather provides for a once-off award to such claimants.  The Scheme provides the appellant with one claim and one claim only and this is clear on a literal interpretation of the 1997 Act and the 2002 Act  and in particular the provision for provisional awards to persons contracting Hepatitis C but not for others affected by that person contracting Hepatitis C.  No injustice is worked by these provisions.  Where the Tribunal make a provisional award pursuant to section 5(7)(a) of the 1997 Act on the basis that a claimant may suffer particular serious consequences in the future and those consequences in fact occur a further claim may be brought and this could include a claim for care and assistance.  Further it is submitted that it is a basic principle governing the award of damages for tort that a plaintiff should have </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;one bite of the cherry</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221; and accordingly having regard to section 5 of the 1997 Act that principle applies to awards by the Tribunal.  Reliance on </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fitzgerald v Kenny</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, it is submitted, is misplaced as in that case the appellant had not completed his litigation as the same was pending by way of appeal to the Supreme Court.  What is in issue on this appeal is not a change of circumstance between a hearing and appeal by way of significant deterioration in circumstances but rather the claimant&#8217;s entitlement to bring a second claim under a statutory scheme where he has already obtained and accepted a final award upon the basis of damages at common law.  </font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Decision</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	The provisions of section 5(1) of the 1997 Act are clear.  See </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">M.O&#8217;C v Minister for Health</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">.  An award by the Tribunal shall be made on the same basis as an award of the High Court calculated by reference to the principles which govern the measure of damages in the law of tort and any relevant statutory provisions.  The section is concerned with the assessment of quantum of an award by the Tribunal and requires that the award of compensation is to be calculated by reference to the principles which govern the measure of damages in the law of torts.  There is no principle affecting an award of damages by the High Court which permits a litigant who has received an award of damages which has become final and unappealable to re-litigate the matter by bringing a further claim.  Further the 1997 Act is clear as to the options available to a claimant once an award is made.  Section 5(9)(a) provides that a claimant may decide in writing either to accept or reject the award or to appeal the award under section 5(15).  The choices are in the alternative.  A claimant who has accepted an award may not appeal the same: </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> D.B. v The Minister for Health and Children and The Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal,</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> unreported, the Supreme Court, 26th March 2003 Denham J.  Section 5(10)(a) provides as follows:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">	&#8220;(10)(a) where a claimant accepts an award (including a provisional award) of the Tribunal, the claimant must agree in writing to waive any right of action which the claimant may otherwise have had against any party and to discontinue any other proceedings instituted by the claimant arising out of the circumstances of the claimant&#8217;s claim before the Tribunal.&#8221;</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	The scheme of the 1997 Act is quite clear that an acceptance of an award brings finality to all claims whether by pursuing a right of action before the courts or other proceedings arising out of the circumstances of the claim. The scheme as a whole provides that an award of compensation shall bring finality except where a provisional award is made to the person who has contracted Hepatitis C pursuant to section 5(7) of the 1997 Act.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	It is then necessary to consider the effect of the amendment of section 4(1)(d) of the 1997 Act by the insertion into the same the words &#8220;or will incur&#8221;.  The decision of O&#8217;Neill J. in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">D.R. v Minister for Health and Children</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> was delivered on the 19th January 2001.  The 2002 Act was enacted on the 29th April 2002.   In </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">D.R. v Minister for Health and Children</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> section 4(1)(d) as contained in the 1997 Act was considered.  The issue was whether the Tribunal had power to make an award in respect of future financial loss or expenses.  O&#8217;Neill J. had regard to the following wording in the provision:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">	&#8220;who has incurred financial loss or expenses as a direct result of providing such care arising from the person being cared for having contracted Hepatitis C.&#8221; </font></i></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	and in respect of this he said:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">	&#8220;In other words the care in respect of which the loss is incurred is an ongoing care. It is not a past care and then it seems to me to be quite explicit in the statutory provision that the care is one which is ongoing.  This being so it must in my view necessarily follow that the section ought to be construed as including loss in respect of that ongoing care which is the case in this instance.  Therefore, I would take the view that subsection (1)(d) does enable the claimant to claim financial loss in respect of providing ongoing care for the persons who are in receipt of that care and hence I must respectfully differ from the Tribunal in that regard.&#8221;</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	Bennion on Statutory Interpretation 2nd edition section 235 provide as follows:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">	&#8220;Under the doctrine of precedent or stare decisis, dynamic processing of an enactment by the court produces sub-rules which are either binding or persuasive authority in relation to the future construction of the enactment.  Where Parliament subsequently indicates that it adopts any such sub-rule, the status of the sub-rule becomes equivalent to that of legislation.&#8221;</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	The Oireachtas is normally presumed to legislate in the knowledge of, and having regard to, relevant judicial decisions.  If, therefore, the Oireachtas has a subsequent opportunity to alter the effect of a decision on the legal meaning of an enactment, but refrains from doing so, the implication may be that the Oireachtas approves of that decision and adopts it.  In support of the proposition Benion relies on </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Denman v Essex Area Health Authority</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> 1984 3 W.L.R. 73.   In the present case in passing the Act of 2002 the Oireachtas had an opportunity to alter the effect of the decision of O&#8217;Neill J. but did not do so.  In these circumstances I am satisfied that the amendment effected by the Act of 2002 to section 4(1)(d) of the Act of 1997 was intended to be declaratory of the law and not an amendment of the same.  The Tribunal accordingly had power under the provisions of the 1997 Act prior to amendment by the 2002 Act to make an award in respect of future financial loss or expenses.  The 2002 Act did not create a new basis of claim.  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fitzgerald v Kenny</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> did not create or recognise a right at common law to bring a series of claims in tort arising out of the same events.  It did not alter the well established principle that one claim only will lie notwithstanding that a claim omitted from the original claim arose subsequent to the final determination of the original claim.  That case was concerned exclusively with the situation which arose subsequent to the making of an award of damages but prior to the determination of an appeal.  It does not assist the appellant.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	For the foregoing reasons I am satisfied that the questions raised should be answered as follows:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">1.	Yes.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2.	No.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3.	Yes.</font>
