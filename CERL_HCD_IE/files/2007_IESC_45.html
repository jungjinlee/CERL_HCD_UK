<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Judgment delivered the 24th day of October, 2007 by Denham J. </font></b>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">1.	Barry O'Brien, the applicant/appellant, hereinafter referred to as 'the applicant', has appealed to this Court from the order and judgment of the High Court (MacMenamin J.) given on the 28th day of July, 2005, whereby the applicant's application for judicial review was declined, and where it was held that the Special Criminal Court had jurisdiction, that the applicant was lawfully before it, and that his trial should proceed.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2.	The applicant is facing trial before the Special Criminal Court on the charge of membership of an unlawful organisation on the 6th April, 2004, pursuant to s.2 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939 to 1998.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3.	It is the applicant's case that the Special Criminal Court has no jurisdiction to try him on the charge because he is not lawfully before the Special Criminal Court for trial under the Offences Against the State Acts, 1939 to 1998 and that the decision of the Special Criminal Court of the 14th December, 2004 was </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">ultra vires</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the powers of the Special Criminal Court. On behalf of the applicant it was submitted that he was not lawfully before the Special Criminal Court:-</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">(i)	Because the arrest power used to make him amenable to the Court, s.4 of the Criminal Law Act, 1997, has no place in the special statutory code which governs the jurisdiction and procedures of the Special Criminal Court.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii)	Even if this Court does not uphold that submission it was contended that that section does not authorise the detention of any person for the purpose of making him amenable to be charged at a later date.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iii)	It was submitted that the means used in this case were prohibited by s.30(A)(1) of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939 to 1998. </font></ul>
<br>
</ul>
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">4.	Leave to apply for Judicial Review</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	On the 17th January, 2005 the applicant was given leave to apply for judicial review for the following reliefs:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">(a)	</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Certiorari</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, quashing the decision of the Special Criminal Court, made on the 14th December, 2004, that the applicant is not unlawfully before the Special Criminal Court on the charge of membership of an unlawful organisation on the 6th day of April, 2004 under section 21 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939 to 1998.  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(b)	Declaration by way of Judicial Review that the Special Criminal Court has no jurisdiction to try the applicant on the charge of membership of an unlawful organisation under section 21 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939/98, because the applicant is unlawfully before the Special Criminal Court.</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	The grounds for the application were:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">	&quot;The Special Criminal Court has no jurisdiction to try the Applicant on the aforesaid charge of membership of an unlawful organisation under section 21 of the Offences Against the State Act 1939, because the Applicant is not lawfully before the Special Criminal Court for trial under the Offences Against the State Act 1939/1998, and the decision of the Special Criminal Court made on the 14th day of December, 2004, to the contrary, was </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">ultra vires</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the Special Criminal Court.&quot;</font></ul>
<br>
</ul>
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">5.	The High Court</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	In a judgment delivered on 28th July, 2005 the High Court, having reviewed the law and the facts, held:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">	&quot;In the light of the foregoing, and having regard to the specific circumstances of this case, the Court will hold that the direction of the Director of Public Prosecutions was sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of the Special Criminal Court and to preclude the jurisdiction of the District Court.  Again having regard to the  time sequence, the totality of circumstances, the absence of any evidence of </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">mala fides</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or prejudice and the convening of the Special Criminal Court at 12 midday on the following Friday this Court will hold that on the facts the applicant has been brought before the Special Criminal Court within a time frame which may be interpreted as immediately and certainly as soon as was practicable.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	It follows from these findings that the Court will hold that the Special Criminal Court has jurisdiction, that the applicant is lawfully before it, and that the  trial should be permitted to proceed in accordance with law.  The Court will therefore decline the application for judicial review.&quot;</font></ul>
<br>
</ul>
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">6.	Grounds of Appeal</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	The applicant has appealed against that decision of the High Court, filing twenty five grounds of appeal.  At the core of this appeal is the query as to how a person may be 'lawfully brought' before the Special Criminal Court.  May a person be lawfully brought before the Special Criminal Court only by way of provisions of the Offences Against the State Acts?  Or, may the provisions of the general criminal law be used by the authorities?  And, is s.30A of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939 to 1998 applicable?  If it is applicable, what is the meaning of 'forthwith'?</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">7.	The Law</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	The Offences Against the State Act, 1939, s.43, provides:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;43.- (1)	A Special Criminal Court shall have jurisdiction to try and to convict or acquit any person </font><u><font size="2" face="Verdana">lawfully brought</font></u><font size="2" face="Verdana"> before that Court for trial under this Act, &#8230;:-</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	[the emphasis is added]</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	The key words are &quot;lawfully brought&quot;.  I shall return to these words later in the judgment.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	Section 47 refers to the bringing of a person before the Special Criminal Court.  It provides:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">47.- (1)	Whenever it is intended to charge a person with a scheduled offence, the Director of Public Prosecutions may, if he so thinks proper, direct that such person shall, in lieu of being, charged with such offence before a justice of the District Court, be brought before a Special Criminal Court and there charged with such offence and, upon such direction being so given, such person shall be brought before a Special Criminal Court and shall be charged before that Court with such offence and shall be tried by such Court on such charge.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(2)	Whenever it is intended to charge a person with an offence which is not a scheduled offence and the Director of Public Prosecutions certifies that the ordinary Courts are, in his opinion, inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order in relation to the trial of such person on such charge, the foregoing sub-section of this section shall apply and have effect as if the offence with which such person is so intended to be charged were a scheduled offence.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(3)	Whenever a person is required by this section to be brought before a Special Criminal Court and charged before that Court with such offence, it shall be lawful for such Special Criminal Court to issue a warrant for the arrest of such person and the bringing of him before such Court and, upon the issue of such warrant, it shall be lawful for such person to be arrested thereunder and brought in custody before such Court.&quot;</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	Relevant law on arrest is to be found in s.4(3) of the Criminal Law Act, 1997, which provides:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">	&quot;Where a member of the Garda Síochána, with reasonable cause, suspects that an arrestable offence has been committed, he or she may arrest without warrant anyone whom the member, with reasonable cause, suspects to be guilty of the offence.&quot;</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	The issue of rearrest is addressed in the Offences Against the State Act, 1939 s.30A, which was inserted by s.11 of the Offences Against the State (Amended) Act, 1998.  This section provides:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">	&quot;The following section is hereby inserted after section 30 of the Act of 1939:</font>
<ul><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;30A. (1)	Where a person arrested on suspicion of having committed an offence is detained pursuant to section 30 of this Act and is released without any charge having been made against him he shall not&#8212;</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">(a)	be arrested again for the same offence, or</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(b)	be arrested for any other offence of which, at the time of the first arrest, the member of the Garda Síochána by whom he was arrested, suspected, or ought reasonably to have suspected, him of having committed, </font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	except under the authority of a warrant issued by a judge of the District Court who is satisfied on information supplied on oath by an officer of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent that further information has come to the knowledge of the Garda Síochána since the person's release as to his suspected participation in the offence for which his arrest is sought.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(2)	Section 30 of this Act, and, in particular, any powers conferred thereby, shall apply to or in respect of a person arrested in connection with an offence to which that section relates under a warrant issued pursuant to subsection (1) of this section as it applies to or in respect of a person to whom that section applies, with the following and any other necessary modifications:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">(a)	the substitution of the following subsection for subsection (3):</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">'(3)	Whenever a person is arrested under a warrant issued pursuant to section 30A(1) of this Act, he may be removed to and detained in custody in a Garda Síochána station, a prison or some other convenient place for a period of 24 hours from the time of his arrest.',</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">(b)	the deletion of subsections (4), (4A) and (4B), and</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(c)	the addition of the following at the end of subsection (4C):</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	or, in case the detention follows an arrest under a warrant issued pursuant to section 30A of this Act, by subsection (3) of this section as substituted by the said section 30A.'.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(4)	Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, a person to whom that subsection relates may be arrested for any offence for the purpose of charging him with that offence forthwith.&quot;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	[the emphasis is added]</font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	Key words relevant to this case are: 'for the purpose of charging him with that offence forthwith'.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">8.	&quot;Lawfully Brought&quot;</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	The first question to be determined is to what the words 'lawfully brought', in s.43 of the Offences Against the State Act 1939 to 1998, refer.  Does it have a restrictive meaning and mean 'lawfully brought' pursuant to procedures under the Offences Against the State Act 1939 to 1998?  Or, does it have a more general meaning, and mean 'lawfully brought' pursuant to law?</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">9.	I am satisfied that the words of s.43(1) are clear.  Provision is made for the jurisdiction of the Special Criminal Court in the words &quot;A Special Criminal Court shall have jurisdiction to try and to convict or acquit &#8230;&quot;.  That jurisdiction may be exercised over &quot;any person lawfully brought before that Court for trial under this Act, &#8230;&quot;.  In construing the words, the issue is whether the words &quot;under this Act&quot; govern the words &quot;lawfully brought&quot;.  I am satisfied that they do not.  Taking a strict construction of the sentence the words 'under this Act' refer only to the words 'for trial'.  Thus the meaning of the sentence is that jurisdiction may be exercised over any person lawfully brought before the Special Criminal Court for trial. There are no express words stating that the person has to be brought before the Court pursuant to the provisions of the Offences Against the State Acts.  While the legislation should be strictly construed, this does not mean it is necessary to seek out a meaning, or indeed to legislate for a meaning, which is not there.  The Act refers simply to 'any person lawfully brought'.  There are no qualifying words to that phrase.  The sentence concludes with the words 'for trial under this Act', and thus clearly provides for a trial pursuant to the Act, which is a specific type of trial.  No words such as 'under this Act' qualify the words 'lawfully brought'.  I am satisfied that the clear meaning of the section, on first principles, is that the term 'lawfully brought' has a general meaning and is not limited to procedures under the Offences Against the State Act 1939 to 1998.  Thus a person may be lawfully brought before the Special Criminal Court in accordance with general law, and not necessarily the specific law of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, as amended.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">10.	I am affirmed in this view by, and I adopt the judgment of, the Court of Criminal Appeal, in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Birney v. D.P.P</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">. [2006] IE CCA 58 (12th May, 2006).  The judgment of the Court was delivered by Hardiman J.  That court held:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">	&quot;In the opinion of the Court, no reason has been advanced as to why a person lawfully arrested under s.4 of the 1997 Act may not, pursuant to s.47 of the 1939 Act, be brought before the Special Criminal Court once the direction of the Director of Public Prosecutions has been given.  Equally, no reason has been advanced for the proposition that the phrase &quot;lawfully brought&quot; should be interpreted as though it read &quot;lawfully brought in the exercise of any power conferred in the Offences Against the State Acts, 1939 to 1998, and not otherwise&#8230;&quot;.  There is simply no warrant for circumscribing the meaning of the phrase &quot;lawfully brought&quot; in the manner proposed by the applicants.&quot;</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	Similarly I adopt and apply the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">The People (D.P.P.) v. Pringle and McCann</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (1981) 2 Frewer 57, where, at p.90 - 91, the judgment of the Court, delivered by O'Higgins C.J. was as follows:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">	&quot;Section 43 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, gives to the Special Criminal Court jurisdiction to try and to convict or acquit any person lawfully brought before that Court but there is nothing in the terms of that section or in the other provisions contained in the Act of 1939 which could be interpreted as confining the method of lawfully bringing before the Special Criminal Court a person to be tried by it to an arrest under Section 30 or pursuant to a warrant of the Court, as is submitted.&quot;</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">11.	I am satisfied that the term 'lawfully brought' in s.43 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, has a general meaning, and is not qualified so as to mean that a person is required to be lawfully brought pursuant to the Offences Against the State Acts, 1939 to 1998.  That conclusion determines the first issue in this appeal.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">12.	Direction by the D.P.P.</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	The Director of Public Prosecutions has power, pursuant to s.47 of the Offences Against the State Act 1939, to direct that a person be brought before the Special Criminal Court to be charged, instead of being charged before the District Court.  Section 47(1) gives to the Director of Public Prosecutions this specific power, an express power, to direct that a person be charged before the Special Criminal Court.  When it is intended to charge a person with a scheduled offence, the Director may, if he so thinks proper, direct that the person shall, &quot;in lieu&quot; of being charged with such offence before the District Court be brought before the Special Criminal Court and &quot;there&quot; charged with the offence.  On such direction being given by the Director, a person shall be brought before the Special Criminal Court and there charged with such offence, and then tried by the Special Criminal Court on that charge.  I am satisfied that the direction of the Director of Public Prosecutions was sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of the Special Criminal Court.  On this issue I would affirm the decision of the High Court. </font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">13.	Arrest</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	The arrest in this case was under s.4 of the Criminal Law Act, 1997.  The section has been set out earlier in this judgment.  This is a statutory form of the common law power of arrest.  It is a general power of arrest.  The Offences Against the State Act, 1939 to 1998, does not specifically exclude the use of the general power of arrest.  To interpret an exclusion of this general power of arrest, from the procedures leading to the use of the jurisdiction of the Special Criminal Court, would require that specific and express words be read into the legislative scheme, either specifically prohibiting such general powers of arrest, or specifically requiring only the use of the Act itself, in prosecutions under the Offences Against the State Act, 1939 to 1998.  No such specific or express words are present in the legislative scheme, nor may they be inferred.  To make such an inference would be to legislate, and so would be a step too far.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	Therefore, I am satisfied that the legislature did not exclude the use of the general power of arrest in the prosecution of offences in, and the exercise of, the jurisdiction of the Special Criminal Court. </font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">14.	'As soon as Practicable'</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	A timescale is provided for in s.15(2) of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, as inserted by s.18 of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1997, which states:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">	&quot;A person arrested without warrant shall, on being charged with an offence, be brought, as soon as practicable, before a judge of the District Court having jurisdiction to deal with the offence concerned.&quot;</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	This timescale envisages that an arrested person will be brought 'as soon as practicable' before the Court, and it has been held to apply to the Special Criminal Court.  Such an approach was taken in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Birney v D.P.P</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">.,  [2006] IE CCA 58 (Court of Appeal, 12th May, 2006), where that Court held, at p.9:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">	&quot;By virtue of s.47, however, the applicants in this case were brought before the Special Criminal Court &#8220;in lieu&#8221; of being brought before the District Court. But that is the only alteration affected by s.47, which appears to me to leave all other rights and obligations that follow upon an arrest intact. The right of the arrested person, and the obligation of the Gardaí, is that he be brought before the relevant Court &#8220;as soon as practicable&#8221;. It is clearly not practicable to bring a person before a court until that Court is sitting and the Special Criminal Court was not sitting in the small hours of the 11/12th October, 2002.&quot;</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	This decision relates to a situation on an arrest.  However, in this case the circumstances are different.  At issue is a re-arrest.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">15.	Re-Arrest</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	As the applicant was re-arrested it is necessary to consider the relevant law.  It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that s.30(A) of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939 to 1998 applies and that pursuant to that section a re-arrest is prohibited, unless, pursuant to s.30(A)(3), the re-arrest is for the purpose of charging him with the offence 'forthwith'.  It was submitted that the word 'láithreach' is used in the first official language in s.30(A)(3) of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939 to 1998, which should be interpreted as 'immediately',  It was submitted that the Oireachtas intended that an accused person released without charge following detention on suspicion of having committed a membership offence might only be re-arrested for the same offence for the purpose of being charged with that offence immediately.  It was submitted that the applicant was detained for a period of fifteen hours and twenty minutes from his re-arrest under s.4 until being charged, and that this cannot be construed as 'immediately'.  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">16.	Section 30A addresses the situation of a re-arrest.  It was inserted by s.11 of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998, and is set out in detail previously in this judgment.  Section 30A(1) commences with a general prohibition of re-arrest.  Thus, &quot;where a person arrested on suspicion of having committed an offence is detained pursuant to section 30 of this Act and is released without any charge having been made against him he shall not - be re-arrested for the same offence &#8230;&quot;  S.30A(1) then provides for an exception in the form of a warrant issued by a judge - which does not apply to this case.  This exception in s.30A is clearly a protection against further detention, except as specifically provided for in s.30A.  The intention manifest in s.30A is that a person on a re-arrest in the circumstances of s.30A may not be detained as if it were a first arrest under s.30.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	This intent is also manifest in s.30A(3).  Section 30A(3) sets out a further exception to the prohibition on a re-arrest in s.30A(1).  It enables the arrest of such a person for the purpose of charging him 'forthwith'.  It thus continues the policy of protecting such a person against detention as if it were an initial s.30 arrest.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	Thus it is necessary to consider the facts to determine the relevant law.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">17.	The Facts</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	The applicant was arrested on 6th April, 2004 at 8.45 pm under s.30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, as amended, on suspicion of having committed the offence of membership of an unlawful organisation on the 6th of April, 2004 under s.21 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, as amended.  He was brought to Balbriggan Garda Station under s.30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939 as amended.  At 8.20 pm on the 7th April, 2004 Chief Inspector Finnegan authorised the extension of the applicant's detention for a period of 24 hours to commence at the expiry of his first period of detention.  At 5.25 pm on the 8th April, 2004 a direction was received from the Director of Public Prosecutions that the applicant be charged with membership of an unlawful organisation.  The applicant was neither charged nor released at that time.  At 8.25 pm on 8th April, 2004 the applicant was released from his detention under s.30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, as amended.  Immediately at 8.35 pm the applicant was re-arrested at Tankardstown, Balbriggan under s.4 of the Criminal Law Act, 1997, for the offence of membership of an unlawful organisation under s.21 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, as amended.  The applicant was cautioned and brought to Balbriggan Garda Station and detained.  At 8.51 pm on the 8th April, 2004 the applicant was informed that he would be brought to the next sitting of the Special Criminal Court and charged there with the offence.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	Attempts had been made to convene a Special Criminal Court.  It was Holy Thursday.  At 8.33 p.m. on that day the Garda Síochána had become aware that the Special Criminal Court had been convened to sit at 12 noon on 9th April, 2004, i.e. Good Friday.  The applicant was told he would be brought before the sitting of the Special Criminal Court at 12 noon the next day, i.e. 9th April, 2004, being Good Friday.  On the 9th April, 2004 the applicant was brought before the Special Criminal Court where he was charged and remanded in custody.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	Thus, the applicant was originally arrested under s.30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, as amended, on 6th April, 2004 at 8.45 pm.  He was then re-arrested under s.4 of the Criminal Law Act, 1997 at 8.35 p.m. on the 8th April, 2004.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">18.	Section 15(2) of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951 would have required that he be brought before the Special Criminal Court as soon as practicable.  As to what is practicable will depend upon all the circumstances of a case.  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	The learned trial judge held:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">	&quot;Again having regard to the time sequence, the totality of circumstances, the absence of any evidence of </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">mala fides</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or prejudice and the convening of the Special Criminal Court at 12 midday on the following Friday this Court will hold that on the facts the applicant has been brought before the Special Criminal Court within a time frame which may be interpreted as immediately and certainly as soon as practicable.&quot; </font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	I would agree that the time was 'as soon as practicable', however, that is not the appropriate test.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">19.	The test to be applied is not 'as soon as practicable'.  Rather, the correct test is whether he was brought 'forthwith', pursuant to s.30A(3) of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, as amended.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	While s.4 of the Criminal Law Act, 1997 may be used to bring a person before the Special Criminal Court, if that arrest is a re-arrest it is a subject to the specific statutory requirement relating to a re-arrest as set out in s.30A of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, as amended.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	Section 30A provides for the situation of a re-arrest after an arrest and detention under the Offence Against the State Act, 1939, as amended.  Thus, even though it was an arrest under s.4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1997, the requirements of s.30A(3), as inserted by s.11 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1998, apply.  For, while the general law may be exercised to bring a person before the Special Criminal Court, when safeguards are established by the specific law of the Offences Against the State Acts, they must be met.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">20.	Therefore it is necessary to consider whether the applicant was charged, pursuant to s.30A(3), that is 'forthwith'.  The word &quot;forthwith&quot; is not a technical term, or a term of art.  It should be given its common and usual meaning. It is defined in the Concise Oxford Dictionary as: &quot;immediately; without delay&quot;.  Thus the law requires that a person in the position of the applicant be charged immediately, without pause or delay.  The term 'forthwith' requires immediate action.  This is in contrast to the pragmatic requirement in the term 'as soon as practicable'.  Counsel referred to an amendment to the law, but any such amendment may not be used to construe the law in issue.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">21.	Was the applicant charged immediately?  The answer has to be in the negative.  He was arrested at 8.35 pm on 8th April, 2004 and charged before the Special Criminal Court shortly after 12.00 noon on 9th April, 2004.  In all the circumstances this was 'as soon as practicable', but that is not the requirement of the law.  The law required that he be charged &quot;forthwith&quot;, and that was not done.  Therefore his detention prior to charging was unlawful </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">22.	For the reasons given I would allow the appeal, quash the decision of the Special Criminal Court of the 14th December, 2004, and declare that the Special Criminal Court has no jurisdiction to try the applicant on the charge.</font>
