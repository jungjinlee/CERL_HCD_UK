<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Judgment delivered the 18th day of November, 2008 by Denham J. </font></b>
<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Section 29 Appeal</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">1.	This is an appeal brought by Michael Boyce, &quot;the appellant&quot;.  His primary appeal is pursuant to s.29 of the Courts of Justice Act 1924, as amended, from the refusal by the Court of Criminal Appeal to grant to him leave to appeal against his conviction in the Central Criminal Court on the 17th November, 2000, on counts of rape, attempted rape, indecent assault and sexual assault.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2.	The following question for this Court was certified by the Court of Criminal Appeal: Is it lawful for a member of An Garda Síochána when taking a sample of blood from a person in custody who voluntarily agrees to provide that sample for the purpose of forensic analysis to do so without having invoked the provisions of Section 2 of the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act 1990?</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Issue</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">3.	It was conceded that the statutory scheme under the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act 1990, &quot;the Act of 1990&quot;, was not engaged.  Therefore, the issue is whether a member of An Garda Síochána was entitled to use the common law in the circumstances of this case</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">4.	For the reasons given in this judgment I am of the opinion that the question should be answered in the affirmative.  A member of An Garda Síochána was entitled to use the common law in the circumstances of this case.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Facts</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">5.	The facts were fully set out by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the judgment of the court delivered by Murray C.J. on the 21st December, 2005.  For the purpose of this appeal, which raises matters of law, I gratefully adopt those facts, which I summarise, to explain the backdrop to the question of law arising.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">6.	The appellant was tried in the Central Criminal Court on the following counts:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">Count No. 1.  Indecent assault contrary to Common Law as provided for in s.10 of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981, on the 31st January, 1983.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Count No. 2.  Rape contrary to s.48 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861 and s.2 of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981, on 5th January, 1984.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Count No. 3.  Indecent assault contrary to Common Law as provided for in s.10 of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981, on the 5th January, 1984.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Count No. 4.  Rape contrary to s.48 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861 and s.2 of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981, on the 6th October, 1985.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Count No. 5.  Indecent assault contrary to Common Law as provided for in s.10 of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981, on the 6th October, 1985.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Count No. 6.  Rape contrary to s.48 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861 and s.2 of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981, on the 22nd December, 1989.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Count No. 7.  Sexual assault contrary to s.2 of the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990, on the 16th August, 1991.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Count No. 8.  Rape contrary to s.48 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861 and s.2 of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981, as amended by s.21 of the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990, on the 10th December, 1994.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Count No. 9.  Sexual assault contrary to s.2 of the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990, on the 10th December, 1994.</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">7.	The appellant was put on trial on the nine counts set out above.  He was found guilty on counts 1, 6 and 7.  On counts 2, 4 and 8 he was found guilty of the alternative verdict of attempted rape.  On counts 3, 5 and 9 the jury reached no verdict.  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">8.	The relevant events occurred between January, 1983 and December, 1994.  All offences related to the same victim and took place in her home.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">9.	The appellant was convicted and sentenced to terms of imprisonment from 3 years to 8 years.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">10.	As described in the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, the appellant was found guilty, where he was so found, by a majority verdict.  On count no. 1 he was found guilty by a majority verdict of ten to two.  On count no. 2 he was found guilty of the offence of attempted rape by a majority verdict of ten to two.  No verdict was returned on count no. 3.  On count no. 4 the jury returned a verdict of not guilty of rape by direction of the trial judge, and the jury found him guilty of attempted rape by a majority of ten to two.  No verdict was returned on count no. 5, as it did not arise in light of the verdict on count no. 4.  The appellant was convicted on count no. 6 by a majority of eleven to one.  He was convicted on count no. 7 by a majority of eleven to one.  He was convicted of the offence of attempted rape in relation to count no. 8 by a majority of ten to two.  No verdict was returned on count no. 9, as it did not arise because of the verdict in relation to count no. 8.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">11.	The offences arise from six occasions between January, 1983 and December 1994 when the complainant was either indecently assaulted, or the subject of a sexual assault involving an attempted rape, or rape.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">12.	The complainant at the time was an unmarried woman living alone in a small house in a rural area.  The house was relatively isolated.  The complainant was born in 1928 and was 55 years of age when the first offence was committed in 1983 and 66 years of age when the last offence was committed in 1994.  She was 72 years of age at the time of the trial.  The complainant did not give evidence identifying the appellant as her assailant.  She gave evidence that it was the same man who sexually assaulted her on each occasion.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">13.	On the first occasion in January, 1983 she was at home in her house when the lights went out.  She heard a noise in the hall and found a man there who said he was from the E.S.B..  He made advances to her.  She used a stick to try and fend him off.  He attempted to rape her.  She described him as a person in his thirties, low size, stocky build.  She said he smelt of oil.  After the event, she ran, in a very distressed state, to her neighbours who called the guards.  It was later found that the fuse box had been interfered with.  In January, 1984 the complainant was asleep when she heard a noise, a man forced his way in the door, pushed the complainant to the floor, and sexually assaulted her, in the dark.  The subsequent events all occurred at her home, when the assailant broke in, and sexually assaulted her, in the dark.  On some occasions the assailant used the same phrases, or made reference to a previous occasion, when he assaulted her.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">14.	At the trial the Director of Public Prosecutions, &quot;the D.P.P.&quot;, relied on DNA evidence from which it was submitted the jury could conclude that the appellant committed two of the offences, those of the 22nd December, 1989 and the 16th August, 1991.  The prosecution submitted that if the jury were satisfied that the DNA evidence established that the appellant committed the offences on those two occasions, then they were entitled to conclude on other evidence that it was the same person who committed all or any of the other offences.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">15.	The DNA evidence was obtained from a blood sample taken from the appellant while he was in custody in the garda station.  The members of An Garda Síochána took the sample on the basis that the appellant had freely consented to giving the sample.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">16.	The appellant was arrested in July, 1996 for the offence of rape of the complainant in December, 1989.  Having been cautioned he was taken to the garda station and processed in the usual way by a member of An Garda Síochána who explained why he was arrested and notified him of his rights.  As is customary, in the course of his detention the appellant was furnished with a note of his rights and informed that arising from information given to An Garda Síochána he was being detained pursuant to s.4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">17.	It is common case that the Gardaí did not rely on the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990, &quot;the Act of 1990&quot;, and so did not follow any of the procedures provided for in the Act of 1990</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Policy </font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">18.	It emerged in the course of the hearing of the appeal before the Court of Criminal Appeal that the members of An Garda Síochána had been advised by the D.P.P., after the coming into force of the Act of 1990, that they might continue to take blood samples provided voluntarily and with consent by persons in custody.  If the person in custody refused to voluntarily provide a blood sample then the gardaí were advised that they may apply the Act of 1990.  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">On the facts of this case, I am satisfied that this is not a case where the matter in issue is the application of a policy of the D.P.P., and whether that policy is appropriate or inappropriate.  Rather it is a question of law.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Central Criminal Court</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">19.	In the Central Criminal Court evidence was given that a member of An Garda Síochána cautioned the appellant as follows:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;You are not obliged to give any sample or to submit to any medical examination unless you wish to do so.  If you do submit to such an examination the findings of same may be given in evidence.&quot; (See Transcripts, Book 1, p.75).  </font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This form of caution was not pursuant to the requirements of the Act of 1990.  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">20.	In the Central Criminal the learned trial judge (Quirke J.) held, as to the DNA sample:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot; I am satisfied that it was voluntarily provided and I have indicated already that Mr Boyce does not deny that.  I am also satisfied that the caution was administered by Detective Garda Burke in the manner in which he stated and in the form in which he stated and I am also satisfied as to the accuracy of the notes of the interview which was recorded by Garda Burke. &quot;  (See Transcripts, Book 3, p.9).  </font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">He held:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;It follows then that the blood samples taken by Dr Dalton on behalf of the Garda Síochána from Michael Boyce were taken after a simple request was made by Detective Garda Burke, together with a caution in precise terms which indicated that Mr Boyce was not required to provide samples unless he voluntarily wished to do so.&quot; (See Transcripts Book 3, p.10).  </font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Further he held:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;I am satisfied that prior to the enactment of the 1990 Act, it was not unlawful for a member of An Garda Síochána to request a person in custody, including a person who is detained under the provisions of Section 30 of the Offences Against the Person Act or Section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 to voluntarily provide bodily samples for forensic testing.  He could, I am satisfied, make a simple request of that kind provided that the detained person was fully advised of his or her rights and, in particular, that he or she had a right to refuse to supply such samples and provided that no coercion, no compulsion, no inducement or no other improper or other influences were exercised or exerted upon such person in order to require them to provide a sample of the kind which is sought.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I am further satisfied that the results of tests carried out upon samples of blood provided voluntarily in such circumstances were admissible at the trial of the detained person in respect of the charges which gave rise to his or her detention.&quot;  (See Transcripts Book 3, p.13-14).  </font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The learned trial judge also considered the terms of the Act of 1990.  He concluded:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;I am satisfied beyond any doubt that the sample of blood provided by the accused in this case on the 10th July, 1996 was provided voluntarily and that the Garda Síochána were empowered to cause to be taken the sample so provided and that the sample was accordingly lawfully provided.  It follows that the results of the tests made upon that sample are admissible in evidence in this trial.&quot;  (See Transcripts Book 3, p.10).  </font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">21.	The DNA evidence was accordingly admitted in evidence and the appellant was found guilty by the jury, as described earlier in this judgment.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">22.	The appellant applied for leave to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal on 20 specific grounds.  The first two grounds of appeal related to the issue as to whether a sample could be taken  from the appellant other than in accordance with the Act of 1990.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Court of Criminal Appeal</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">23.	The Court of Criminal Appeal considered the Act of 1990.  It held:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;It would indeed be extraordinary if the Oireachtas contemplated that any forensic sample freely and voluntarily provided by a person in custody and then forensically examined by the Gardaí which was lawful before the passing of the Act should be considered unlawful after the passing of the Act without any express provision to that effect, even though it was provided without any element of coercion and when the consequences of the refusal were nil from the point of view of an accused.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Act creates a distinct statutory regime fundamentally different in nature and consequences from the gathering of evidence under common-law rules or powers and does not have the effect of abolishing the right or faculty of Gardaí to take or accept forensic samples from persons in custody that are voluntarily provided. It is an extension of the law rather than an abrogation of the existing law. Although the learned trial judge decided that the provisions of the Act of 1990 did not apply to the circumstances of this case from a different legal perspective the end result is the same. Since the Act does not apply and the blood sample was provided voluntarily he was bound to admit the relevant evidence. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In conclusion the Court is of the view that the Act does not purport to abolish expressly or by implication the possibility of the Gardaí to receive from persons in custody a forensic sample, such as blood, voluntarily provided.&quot;</font></ul>
<br>
</ul>
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Context</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">24.	The position of the appellant should be considered in its context.  The appellant was being detained pursuant to s.4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  It was in that situation that he was asked to give his consent to voluntarily provide a blood sample.  This brings us back to the question posed - whether in such circumstances the appellant could give his consent voluntarily, or whether this was prohibited by the Act of 1990.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Powers under Criminal Justice Act, 1984</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">25.	The powers of the Garda Síochána, detailed in s.6 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, are as follows:- </font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;6.&#8212;(1) Where a person is detained pursuant to section 4, a member of the Garda Síochána may&#8212;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(a) demand of him his name and address;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(b) search him or cause him to be searched;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(c) photograph him or cause him to be photographed;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(d) take, or cause to be taken, his fingerprints and palm prints;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(e) make or cause to be made any test designed for the purpose of ascertaining whether he has been in contact with any firearm (within the meaning of the Firearms Acts, 1925 to 1971) or with any explosive substance (within the meaning of the Explosive Substances Act, 1883) and for that purpose take swabs from his skin or samples of his hair;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(f) seize and retain for testing anything that he has in his possession.&quot;</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Sections 6(1) - (4) were modified by the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996 s.5.  The Act of 1996 was commenced by the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996 (Commencement) Order 1996.  Section 6 of the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act 1990 repealed s.6(1)(e) of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  The Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act 1990 (Commencement) Order 1992 brought that Act into operation on the 5th June, 1992.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Section 6(2) of the Act of 1984 mandates that the powers in s.1(c) and 1(d) shall not be exercised except with the authority of a member of An Garda Síochána not below the rank of Superintendent.  Subsection (4) of s.6 provides that any person who obstructs or attempts to obstruct any member of An Garda Síochána or any other person acting under the powers in conferred by subsection (1) or fails or refuses to give his name and address, or gives a false or misleading name or address, shall be guilty of an offence.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thus the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 expressly provides powers to An Garda Síochána in relation to the taking of information or certain identifying samples from a detained person  </font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Act of 1990</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">26.	The Act of 1990 is at the core of this case.  Thus it requires to be construed carefully.  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Act of 1990 is described in the long title as &quot;an Act to amend and extend the law to authorise the taking of bodily samples for forensic testing from persons suspected of certain criminal offences&quot;.  Thus it is an Act to &quot;amend&quot; the law.  The word &quot;amend&quot; indicates a change in the law.  In addition, it is an Act to &quot;extend&quot; the law, which suggests a development of the law.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Persons</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">27.	The Act of 1990 defines the persons to whom the Act applies.  The long title of the Act of 1990 refers to &quot;persons suspected of certain criminal offences&quot;.  However, the sections of the Act, which state the law, are more specific.  Section 2(1) provides that it applies to a person in custody under the provisions of s.30 of the Offences against the State Act, 1939 or s.4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  Also s.2(2) applies the statute to a person in prison.  Therefore, the persons to whom the Act of 1990 may apply are limited.  (Section 2(1) of the Act of 1990 has been amended by the inclusion of s.2 of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996).</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">28.	 It is clear that the &quot;appellant&quot; could qualify as a &quot;person&quot; under the Act of 1990, as he was in custody under s.4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">29.	However, the procedures under s.2 of the Act of 1990 were not utilised.  The common law was applied.  The appellant consented to the giving of a sample, having been cautioned in the terms set out earlier in this judgment, which was accepted by the learned trial judge, and admitted in evidence.  </font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Prison</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">30.	Where the person is in prison the Act of 1990 further requires that the sample sought be required in connection with an offence other than the offence in respect of which he is in prison or an offence which he could be convicted on indictment.  Also, the sample required should be in connection with an investigation of an offence under the Offences Against the State Act, 1939 or an offence which is a scheduled offence under Part V of that Act or an offence to which s.4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 applies.  This aspect of the Act is not in issue.  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Just for completeness I note that s.2(3) of the Act of 1990 was amended by s.3(a) of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Consent</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">31.	It is noteworthy that under both the Act of 1990 and the common law, the consent of a person is required.  The facts of this case illustrate the giving of consent under common law.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">32.	The Act of 1990 established a scheme for the giving of certain samples.  It established a specific system for the giving of consent.  Is the scheme mandatory?  I shall address this question later in the judgment.  However, for the purpose of this judgment the consent is not in issue.  </font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Power to take or cause to be taken</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">33.	Section 2 of the Act of 1990 gives power to members of An Garda Síochána to take, or cause to be taken, bodily samples.  It provides:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;2.&#8212;(1) Subject to the provisions of subsections (4) to (8) of this section, where a person is in custody under the provisions of section 30 of the Offences against the State Act, 1939 , or section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 , a member of the Garda Síochána may take, or cause to be taken, from that person for the purpose of forensic testing all or any of the following samples, namely&#8212;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(a) a sample of&#8212;</font>
<ul><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(i) blood,</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii) pubic hair,</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iii) urine,</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iv) saliva, </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(v) hair other than pubic hair,</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(vi) a nail,</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(vii).any material found under a nail,</font></ul>
<br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(b) a swab from any part of the body other than a body orifice or a genital region,</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(c) a swab from a body orifice or a genital region,</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(d) a dental impression,</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(e) a footprint or similar impression of any part of the 	person's body other than a part of his hand or mouth&quot;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(This section was amended by s.3 of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996 by substituting &quot;section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 or section 2 of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996&quot; for &quot;or section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984&quot;). </font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Subsections (4) to (8) set out requirements to be met by An Garda Síochána before they take, or cause to be taken, a sample.  I shall address them later in the judgment.  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Section 2(1) identifies the persons to whom the Act of 1990 may relate and states that &quot;a member of the Garda Síochána may take, or cause to be taken&quot; from that person, samples.  This is an enabling provision.  It does not state that any other process is amended or abolished.  It does not state that these provisions are in place of any other scheme. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The scheme is extended also to a person in prison, but is expressly limited to the offences for which it may be obtained.  Section 2(2) provides:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;(2) Subject to the provisions of subsections (3) to (8) of this section, where a person is in prison, a member of the Garda Síochána may take, or cause to be taken, from that person for the purpose of forensic testing all or any of the samples specified in subsection (1) of this section.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(3) The power conferred by subsection (2) of this section shall only be exercisable&#8212;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(a) where the sample to be taken is required in connection with an offence other than the offence in respect of which the person is in prison or an offence of which he could be convicted on an indictment alleging that offence, and</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(b) where the sample to be taken is required in connection with an investigation in respect of the commission of an offence under the Offences against the State Act, 1939 , or an offence which is for the time being a scheduled offence for the purposes of Part V of that Act or an offence to which section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 , applies.&quot;</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(This too is amended by s.3 of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1999.)</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Further Parameters</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">34.	The parameters of the scheme are further stated in s.2(4) to s.2(8).  The scheme is detailed.  Authorisation is required of a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of Superintendent, consent in writing, suspicion of reasonable grounds and that the sample will tend to confirm or disprove that person's involvement.  Specific information is required to be given to the person of the nature of the offence suspected, the authorisation, and its grounds.  Thus s.2(4) provides:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;(4) A sample may be taken under this section only if&#8212;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(a) a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent authorises it to be taken, and</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(b) in the case of a sample mentioned in subparagraph (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of this section, or in paragraph (c) or (d) of the said subsection (1), the appropriate consent has been given in writing.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(5) An authorisation to take a sample under this section shall not be given unless the member of the Garda Síochána giving it has reasonable </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(a) for suspecting the involvement of the person from whom the sample is to be taken&#8212;</font>
<ul><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(i) in a case where the person is in custody, in the offence in respect of which he is in custody, or</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii) in a case where the person is in prison, in the commission of an offence under the Offences against the State Act, 1939 , or an offence which is for the time being a scheduled offence for the purposes of Part V of that Act or an offence to which section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 , applies,</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">and</font></ul>
<br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(b) for believing that the sample will tend to confirm or disprove the involvement of the person from whom the sample is to be taken in the said offence.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(6) Before a member of the Garda Síochána takes, or causes to be taken, a sample under subsection (1) of this section, or seeks the consent of the person from whom the sample is required to the taking of such a sample, the member shall inform the person&#8212;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(a) of the nature of the offence in which it is suspected that that person has been involved,</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(b) that an authorisation has been given under subsection (4) (a) of this section and of the grounds on which it has been given, and</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(c) that the results of any tests on the sample may be given in evidence in any proceedings.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(7) An authorisation under subsection (4) (a) of this section may be given orally but, if it is given orally, it shall be confirmed in writing as soon as is practicable.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(8) A sample of a kind specified in subparagraph (i) or (ii) of paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of this section or in paragraph (c) of the said subsection (1) may be taken only by a registered medical practitioner and a dental impression may be taken only by a registered dentist or a registered medical practitioner.</font></ul>
<br>
</ul>
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Obstruction</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">35.	The Act creates an offence of obstruction.  If any one obstructs the process they may be committing an offence.  Section 2(9) provides:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;A person who obstructs or attempts to obstruct any member of the Garda Síochána or any other person acting under the powers conferred by subsection (1) of this section shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.&quot;</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The terms of this section are very similar to s.6(4) of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  It is clearly a subsection which may be used by the D.P.P. </font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Appropriate Consent under the Act</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">36.	The Act of 1990 deals expressly with the consent appropriate to persons of different ages.  Section 2(10) provides:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;In this Act &quot;appropriate consent&quot; means&#8212;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(a) in the case of a person who has attained the age of 17 years, the consent of that person,</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(b) in the case of a person who has not attained the age of 17 years but has attained the age of 14 years, the consent of that person and of a parent or guardian of that person, and</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(c) in the case of a person who has not attained the age of 14 years, the consent of a parent or guardian of that person.&quot;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(Section 2(10)(a) has been amended by Regulation 4, Appendix A of the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act 1990 Regulations 1992, S.I. No. 130 of 1992).</font></ul>
<br>
</ul>
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Inference</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">37.	Much of the Act of 1990 established a system which envisages significant regulation which may be construed as being to the advantage of a person in custody or prison, for their protection.  	However, there is also an aspect of this legislation which may be negative to an accused.  The Act of 1990 may enable inferences to be drawn from a refusal to give a sample.  Such a statutory inference may be detrimental to an accused.  In essence, s.3 of the Act of 1990 states that where a consent required under s.2 is refused without good cause the court may draw such inferences, if any, from the refusal.  The refusal may, on the basis of such inference, be treated as amounting to corroboration of any evidence in which the refusal is material, but a person may not be convicted of an offence solely on such inference.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is an important amendment and extension of the law.  It creates an exception to the rule that a suspect ought not to be obliged to provide evidence which may incriminate him.  This statutory amendment and extension of the law may be detrimental to an accused, should he refuse to give consent, as that refusal may be used in court against him.  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This does not exist in the common law.  No such evidence may be given of a refusal to give a sample under common law.  Nor may any inference be drawn from such a refusal.  Nor may it be used as corroboration. </font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Penal Statute</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">38.	The Act of 1990 may have significant negative consequences for a relevant person.  Thus it should be construed strictly.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Powers&quot; under s.2(11)</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">39.	Section 2(11) of the Act of 1990 states:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The powers conferred by this section are without prejudice to any other powers exercisable by a member of the Garda Síochána.&quot;</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">What does this mean?  It refers to the &quot;powers&quot; conferred by this section.  This section refers to the power to take, or cause to be taken, samples within a statutory scheme.  Thus these powers are without prejudice to any other powers exercisable by a member of the Garda Síochána.  They may refer to the powers of the Garda Síochána across the whole panoply of our system of investigation.  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The issue was referred to by the Court of Criminal Appeal, as follows:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;At this point it should be said that the learned trial judge, in his ruling admitting the evidence in issue did so principally on the basis that s. 2(11) of the Act of 1990 in stating that the powers conferred on the Gardaí under the Act were without prejudice to other powers exercised by them, meant that the &#8216;power&#8217; of the Gardaí to invite persons to voluntarily provide a blood sample applied in this case and therefore were unaffected by the provisions of the Act. This point is mentioned now because counsel for the D.P.P., at the hearing of this application, stated that he was not relying on the subsection as a section which saved a specific &#8216;power&#8217; of the Gardaí to take such a sample. He relied generally on the lawfulness of a request of persons in custody to voluntarily provide a sample and it being permissible to take it when the request is voluntarily acceded to. Counsel submitted that the Act of 1990 did not affect the power or right of the Gardaí to take a blood sample when voluntarily given.&quot;</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">A similar approach was adopted by counsel for the D.P.P. in this Court.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">40.	This statutory regime makes provision for a power, where a person is in custody under specified statutes, for a member of An Garda Síochána to take, or cause to be taken, from a person, for the purpose of forensic testing, the specified samples.  It relates solely to persons in custody or in prison as specified in legislation.  It provides that a member of An Garda Síochána &quot;may&quot; take or cause to be taken the samples.  </font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Safeguards for the person</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">41.	The Act provides safeguards for the person.  These are essentially to be found in subsections (4) to (8) set out previously in this judgment.  </font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">(i)  Thus a sample may be taken under the section only if it is authorised by a member of An Garda Síochána not below the rank of Superintendent, and, in the case of specified samples (which are particularly intrusive) an appropriate consent is required to be given in writing.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii) Further, an authorisation to take a sample under this section shall not be given unless the member of An Garda Síochána has reasonable grounds for suspecting the involvement of the person from whom the sample is to be taken, where the person is in custody, in respect of the offence on which he is in custody.  Or, if the person is in prison, in the commission of an offence under the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, or an offence which is for the time being a scheduled offence for the purpose of Part V of that Act or an offence to which s.4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 applies.  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iii) In addition to the suspicion mentioned above, the member of An Garda Síochána is required to believe that the sample will tend to confirm or disprove the involvement of the person from whom the sample is to be taken in the said offence.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iv) Before a member of An Garda Síochána takes the sample or seeks the consent of the person, he is required to inform the person:- </font>
<ul><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(a) of the nature of the offence in which it is suspected the person is involved,</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(b) that an authorisation has been given, and the grounds on which it has been given, and</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(c) that the results of any tests on the sample may be given in evidence in any proceedings.</font></ul>
<br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(v) It is required that a medical practitioner or a dentist take certain specified samples.  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(vi) Reference is made to &quot;appropriate consent&quot;, enabling a person of 17 years to give consent, but special provisions are made for younger persons.</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">These are details of the scheme which may provide safeguards for a person.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Regulations</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">42.	The Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act 1990 Regulations 1992, came into operation on the 5th June, 1992.  Very specific requirements are set out in the regulations.  Once again the matter is dealt with in a detailed fashion.  A record of information given under s.2(b) of the Act of 1990 is required, recording the giving of the information, the name and rank of the member of An Garda Síochána who gave it, and the date and time when it was given, and the entry must be signed by the person making it.  There is also required to be a record of the consent to the taking of the sample, or of the refusal of consent.  The member in charge is required to record the giving or refusal of consent, together with the date and time.  Where consent is given the document containing it shall be attached to the custody order or prison record.  The member in charge is required to record the following particulars on the custody record or prison record:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">(a) the name of the person from whom the sample was taken,</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(b) the offence in respect of which the sample was taken,</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(c) the nature of the sample,</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(d) the name of the person who took the sample,</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(e) the date and time the sample was taken and the manner in which it was taken, and the entry shall be signed by the person making it. </font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Forms are set out to be used for the purpose of providing a record.  Each is required to be attached to the custody or prison record of the person concerned.  These forms are detailed.  The first relates to a person aged 17 years or over.  Forms are provided also for consent by a person aged 14, 15 or 16 years, and for the consent of his parent or guardian, to the taking of a sample from him; and for consent of a parent or guardian of a person aged less than 14 years to the taking of a sample from him.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Submissions</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">43.	Written submissions were filed on behalf of the appellant and of the D.P.P.  The Court also had the benefit of oral submissions on the issues of law before the Court, from Mr David Goldberg S.C., on behalf of the appellant and from Mr Michael Durack S.C. on behalf of the D.P.P.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Decision</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">44.	A new era in human knowledge dawned with the discovery of DNA.  Generally, this had an effect in many areas.  Specifically, from the information gained of DNA, forensic scientists have been able to use DNA in samples to obtain a DNA profile and so to identify a person, or to exclude a person, from a crime scene.  This has brought significant new evidence to trials, indeed sometimes such evidence may be the cornerstone of a trial.  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">45.	The primary question of law in issue on this appeal, certified by the Court of Criminal Appeal, is set out in paragraph 2 above and relates to the obtaining of a sample so that DNA may be analysed and evidence of the DNA used in trial.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">46.	The taking of a sample is an invasive act upon a person.  It raises issues including bodily integrity, human dignity, and the right not to incriminate oneself.  These are matters of constitutional importance and require constitutional protection.  Where consent is given, as it was here, the matter moves on and the issue is not whether or not there was consent, but what is the applicable law?  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">47.	Under our common law it has long been accepted that members of An Garda Síochána may obtain samples from a person if consent is given voluntarily.  However, that is not the issue here.  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">At issue here is the effect of the Act of 1990 on the common law.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Comparative Law</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">48.	The Court was referred to the law of other states.  However, I have not found it to be helpful.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(i)  Reference was made to the Canadian case </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">R v. Borden</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1994] 3S.C.R 145.  The facts there were entirely different.  While the blood sample was taken from an accused with consent the police failed to advise him of the predominant purpose for which they wanted the sample - an offence other than the one for which he was in custody.  The issue was thus one of the information given to an accused.  That is not in issue on this appeal.  In </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">R v. Borden </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Iacobucci J. stated:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;In this case, the key evidence necessary to the Crown's case was obtained from the respondent in circumstances where he was completely uninformed about the main purpose of the police in requesting it from him.  Therefore, regardless of how the evidence is classified, its admission would render the trial unfair.&quot;</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The facts of that case are entirely different to those of this case, where there was found by the trial court to be an informed consent.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii)  Reference was made also to </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">R v. Stillman,</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1997] I.S.C.R. 607, the Supreme Court of Canada considered a case where DNA evidence had been taken.  An accused, 17 years old, had been arrested for the murder of a teenage girl.  At the police station the accused's lawyers informed the police by letter that the accused was not consenting to provide any bodily samples, including hair and teeth imprints, or to give any statements.  Once the lawyers left, police officers took hair samples under threat of force.  Plasticine teeth impressions were also obtained.  The accused was subsequently released, but arrested again several months later.  At that time a dentist took new impressions of the accused's teeth without his consent and more hair was taken from him, as well as a saliva sample and buccal swabs.  The trial judge held that the evidence was obtained in violation of s.8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, but held that it was admissible.  The accused was convicted of murder.  The majority of a Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge's ruling.  The Supreme Court of Canada held that the appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered at which the hair samples, buccal swabs and dental impressions should be excluded.  McLachlin J. dissented on the review of the balancing act to be done by a trial judge when evidence was obtained illegally pursuant to the Charter.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The facts are entirely different to the matter here.  There was no consent given.  The evidence was obtained contrary to the Charter.  Reference was made to a recent amendment of the criminal code in Canada to create a warrant procedure in Canada for the seizure of certain bodily substances for the purpose of DNA testing.  Speaking of Canadian law Cory J. stated, in reference to the new system:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;If this type of invasive search and seizure came within the common law power of search incident to arrest, it would not have been necessary for the government to have created a parallel procedure for the police to follow.  In my view, it would be contrary to authority to say that this is no more than a codification of the common law.&quot;</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Reference was made to a situation where no consent was given.  In this case consent was given.  Thus it is not a case of determining whether the taking of such samples contrary to consent is legal.  Any analysis in this State would start with issues of bodily integrity, human dignity, privacy and issues of self incrimination.  I can find no assistance in this judgment for the analysis required in this case.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iii)  Reference was made also to </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Queen v. Ireland</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1970] 126 C.L.R. 321 of the High Court of Australia.  However, in that case the evidence was obtained illegally, without the informed consent of the accused, and the Court addressed the balancing act to be applied when considering whether evidence obtained by means of unlawful or unfair acts should be admitted.  The issue in this case is different, and the applicable law is different. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iv)  While I have considered the cases to which the Court was referred I have found that they are no assistance to this case.  This appeal concerns the construction of a statute, the Act of 1990, and the issue revolves around that Act.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Conclusion on s.29 application</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">50.	There is no doubt that the common law enables the taking of samples from a person with their consent.  The question is whether the common law was ousted by the Act of 1990?  Whether the Act of 1990 supersedes the common law?  Or, whether the Act of 1990 runs parallel to the common law?</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">51.	This is not a case of an improper policy.  The D.P.P. advised the Garda Síochána.  It was an interpretation of the Act of 1990.  The issue on this appeal is whether that interpretation was correct.  This depends on the construction of the Act of 1990.  As has been set out previously in this judgment, the Act of 1990 is a detailed piece of legislation.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">52.	However, it is noteworthy that there is no section in the Act of 1990 which explicitly states that the Act of 1990 only shall apply to the specified persons in custody or in prison.  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">53.	There is no section of the Act of 1990 which states expressly that the common law is ousted by the statute.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">54.	There is no section of the Act of 1990 which states expressly that the common law is preserved by the statute.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">55.	There being no express intent of the Oireachtas in the Act on this issue it is a matter of construing the Act of 1990 to determine the intent of the legislature.  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">56.	The intent of the Oireachtas is best expressed in the words of the Act.  It is important therefore to construe those words to find the intent.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">57.	The common law approach to obtaining information by consent is well established.  It is a fundamental aspect of the approach to investigating crime.  It is a practical approach.  Any alteration to such a fundamental aspect of criminal investigation would require a clear expression of an intent to change.  No such approach is apparent from the words of the Act.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">58.	The Act of 1990 in s.2(11) expressly states that the powers conferred by this section are without prejudice to any other powers exercisable by a member of the Garda Síochána.  This section confers powers to take, or cause to be taken, samples, within the scheme provided.  It is a matter of construing the subsection to determine to what this reference is made.  It expressly retains powers of the Garda Síochána.  By inference it is referring to the establishment of a scheme which does not alter the powers of the Garda Síochána.  This express and implied construction indicates an intent to establish a new legislative scheme, but not to change existing law.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">59.	Consequently the common law remains unchanged - but to what extent?  Clearly it continues to apply in situations not specifically referred to in the Act of 1990.  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">60.	One could envisage the voluntary giving of samples by many persons in an area in reaction to a crime which has been committed locally:  a community response.  The common law enables a practical and efficient way to obtain samples, with consent, from the local population.  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">61.	The legislative scheme is clear and established in plain words.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">62.	There are detrimental consequences to a 'person' under the Act of 1990.  For example, the 'inference' which may be raised at the trial, and upon which a jury may rely for corroboration.  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Also there is the possibility of the offence of obstruction under s.2(9).  Therefore, to apply such a scheme in the absence of a clear mandatory requirement under the statute would be a step too far.  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It would be moving from the judicial into the legislative power.  The intent of the Oireachtas should be perceived from the words in the statute.  If they are not clear then the benefit, in a penal section, should be given to an accused.  The possibility of such an inference being raised is clearly not to the benefit of an accused.  Nor is the offence of obstruction.  It should also be noted that if the common law applies and there is an issue as to the &quot;consent&quot;, which is not unusual at trial, then the voluntary basis of the consent is a matter of proof for the D.P.P.  This may be a heavier burden for the D.P.P. than the paperwork which is required to be produced under the Act of 1990.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">63.	I am satisfied that the Oireachtas did not intend to exclude the common law when it passed the Act of 1990.  I am satisfied that the common law may also be applied to a person detained or in prison as referred to in s.2 of the Act of 1990.  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is no express intent of the Oireachtas to exclude this application of the common law.  There is no express mandatory application of the scheme to all persons detained in the manner referred to in the Act of 1990.  Consequently to interpret the scheme as compulsory would not flow from the plain words of the Act.  Such an interpretation would be a legislative extension of the Act of 1990.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">64.	The Act of 1990 was a statute to add to the law and to create a new scheme.  This scheme exists in tandem with the common law.  The Act of 1990 provided an alternative.  Consequently it was open to the Garda Síochána to use the common law in the circumstances of this case.  Thus I would answer the question posed in the affirmative.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Other Grounds</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">65.	On behalf of the appellant other grounds of appeal were also raised, having been permitted on foot of a motion brought previously to the Court.  Both written and oral submissions were advanced.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">66.	Mr Keane, B.L. brought two grounds of appeal specifically to the attention of the Court.  The first ground he raised was that the trial court:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Failed to give a direction (in particular in relation to Counts other than those which relied on DNA evidence) to the Defence on the points raised at the close of the prosecution case (and in particular the lack of evidence to corroborate the DNA evidence in the case) and failed to correctly and adequately charge the jury regarding corroboration required in cases of this nature.&quot;</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Reference was made to </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">The People (Director of Public Prosecutions) v. M.K.</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2005] 3 I.R. 423, and the Court's attention was drawn to the charge of the trial judge and to the submitted absence of a proper definition of corroboration.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">However, there was no requisition of this point at the trial.  This may well have been a tactical decision.  But whatever the reason, the absence of a requisition is a critical factor.  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Court of Criminal Appeal addressed the issue of the absence of a requisition fully.  It was stated:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Towards the end or latter part of the trial judge's charge, the jury were allowed to go to lunch and between that point and the resumption of the charge a number of submissions were made by counsel for the defence in relation to the charge.  Moreover at the conclusion of the charge itself a number of requisitions were made and the jury were recalled and recharged in relation in particular to the evidence of Mr William Boyce and the alibi which the defence contended this gave to the accused in respect of one of the offences.  Secondly, the submission is outside the ambit of the grounds set out in the Notice of Appeal and this Court must address those grounds only.  Thirdly, this Court has consistently stated over many years that it is the duty of counsel for the defence (and indeed the prosecution) to draw to the attention of the trial judge any deficiencies which they consider to exist in relation to the charge to the jury.  If the defence are of the view that deficiencies which they consider to exist in relation to the charge are so grave or extensive as not to be capable of being corrected by redirecting the jury (such as that it was so biased in favour of the State and against the defence that the making of requisition would be a fruitless exercise), the appropriate and proper approach of counsel for the defence is to seek to have the jury discharged on those grounds.  Should the trial judge decline to do so, then the appropriate grounds can be set out for an appeal.  In this case the defence had every opportunity to make such requisitions regarding the charge as it thought appropriate.  It did make certain requisitions and these were dealt with by the learned trial judge as he thought appropriate.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">No requisition having been raised with the trial judge concerning his direction to the jury on the question of corroboration the Court is doubtful, in the circumstances of the case, whether it is a question which is of such fundamental importance in the circumstances of the case that is should address the matter in any case.  Notwithstanding those concerns it may be said that this was a case in which the trial judge was not bound to give a direction to the jury on the issue of corroboration having regard to the provisions of s.7 of the Criminal law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990.  There was no witness who purported to contradict the complainant's evidence that she had been sexually assaulted and she did not, in her evidence before the Court, purport to identify the accused as the person who assaulted her but the trial judge was nonetheless very careful to point out to the jury that the onus at all times rested on the prosecution to prove their case beyond reasonable doubt and while they were entitled to rely on her evidence as evidence that she was sexually assaulted they were not bound to do so.&quot;</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Court of Criminal Appeal quoted the direction of the learned trial judge, and then concluded on this issue:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;In his charge to the jury the learned trial judge pointed out that such matters as the evidence of immediate complaint to others concerning the assaults which the complainant said had been committed against her was not evidence which corroborated the case against the accused but was evidence which was consistent with the fact that she had been assaulted. At one point in the above passage he used the word corroboration. It is clear from its context and the context of the charge relating to the facts of the case as a whole that he was not conveying that the evidence in question was corroboration of any allegation of guilt on the part of the accused. That was a question which they had to come to later and separately and that he was still referring to matters which were simply consistent. If anything the charge on this matter was in ease of the defence. In any event the Court is satisfied that there was no misdirection of the jury nor did it give rise to any unfairness or injustice in the case.&quot;</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I would confirm the approach of the Court of Criminal Appeal.  Nor do I consider there are any other grounds upon which to allow an appeal on this aspect of the appeal, in all the circumstances of the case.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Counsel also raised specifically that the trial court:-</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">67.	&quot;Erred in law regarding the ruling on Section 5 of the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992 (regarding the Section 6 Certificate) grounding McDonnell's evidence about the English Database used for DNA samples in general and erred in law in allowing evidence of databases to be used which were not properly validated.&quot;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It was pointed out that objections had been made at the trial.  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Mr Birmingham, S.C. explained at the trial that he did not seek to put any of the databases into evidence.  He was simply going to ask Mr McDonnell to give an expert opinion as to the significance of particular matters.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This issue was considered carefully by the Court of Criminal Appeal and I would adopt the analysis of that court.  This aspect of the argument by the appellant could have been further developed by experts of his own in a challenge at the trial.  That was not done.  I am satisfied that no case has been made out to allow this ground of appeal.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Conclusion</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">68.	In conclusion, I would answer the question raised on this s.29 appeal in the affirmative.  Currently two systems exist for the taking of such samples.  The common law is not ousted by the Act of 1990.  I would not allow the appeal on this or any of the other grounds raised.</font>
