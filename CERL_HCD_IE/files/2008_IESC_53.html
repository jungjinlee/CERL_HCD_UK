<br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">1.	</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">This is an appeal by Ivans Desjatnikovs, the respondent/appellant, &quot;the appellant&quot;, from an order and judgment of the High Court (Peart J.), given on the 10th October, 2007, which ordered the surrender of the appellant to the Republic of Latvia on a European arrest warrant.</font><br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">2.	     </font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The European arrest warrant was issued by a judicial authority in Riga on the 7th December, 2005.  It was endorsed by the High Court for execution on the 23rd January, 2007.  The </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">appellant was arrested on the 31st January, 2007 and brought before the High Court.  Subsequently the matter came before the High Court for determination pursuant to s.16 of the European </font><br>

<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	At issue in this appeal is the offence on the European arrest warrant, and whether it is one upon which an order may be made directing the surrender of the appellant.</font><br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">4.	      </font></b><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The offence on the European Arrest Warrant</font></u></b><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	      The European arrest warrant states that it relates to one offence.  It provides at paragraph (e):-</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		&quot;(e) Offences</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		This warrant relates to in total 1 (one) criminal offence.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		Description of the circumstances in which the offence(s) was (were) committed, including the time, place and degree of participation in the offence(s) by the requested person: Ivans Desjatnikovs, id. no. 300653-10235, being the chairman of the board of the holding company - pawnshop &quot;OMEGA&quot; (reg. No. 40003231019, legal address: Riga street 34, Daugavpils), being the materially responsible person, in January-February 2002 handed out to himself for his economic needs from the cash desk of the pawnshop sums of money in cash and up till now had not accounted for disposal of 45000 Lvl, as well as had not returned the money in the cash desk.  The power to act with the property and means of the pawnshop was delegated to I. Desjatnikovs according to Article 22 of Statutes of the holding company - pawnshop &quot;Omega&quot;.  The money was handed out by filling in the following documents:</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">			-	cash expense order No. 1 from 2 January 2002 for the amount of 44000,00Lvl;</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">			-	cash expense order No. 8 from 30 January 2002 for the amount of 552,15Lvl;</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">			-	cash expense order No. 9 from 6 February for the amount of 516,85Lvl.</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">I.Desjatnikovs has signed the mentioned orders as the materially responsible person, confirming the fact of handing out of the money from the cash desk, as well as the receiver of the money, confirming the fact of receipt of the money.  Moreover the fact of money receipt was entered in the cashbook of the pawnshop, where in pages No. 1 on 2 January 2002, No. 18 on 30 January 2002 and No. 22 on 6 February 2002 I.Desjatnikovs, had placed his signature.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Also in pre-trial investigation it is established that Ivans Desjatnikovs, being the chairman of the board of the holding company - pawnshop &quot;Omega&quot;, in 2001, the more precise date is not established, presenting himself as an employee of the mentioned pawnshop, received money in the amount of 7300Lvl as a loan from his acquaintance Anna Greckina and undertook to pay to A.Greckina 2% of the amount monthly.  Further on I. Desjatnikovs did not fulfil his obligations.  Thereof the heir of A.Greckina's rights - her daughter Natalija Iljina, born in 1951, insisted on the official drawing up of the afore mentioned loan agreement.  On 17.11.2001 I.Desjatnikovs, identifying himself as the manager of the pawnshop &quot;Omega&quot;, actually being the chairman of the board of the pawnshop, and Natalija Iljina has signed the loan agreement, according to which the creditor Natalija Iljina grants the pawnshop &quot;Omega&quot; for a term of one year sum of money in the amount of 7300Lvl for production activities and the pawnshop undertakes to pay to Natalija Iljina monthly 2% of the amount on the 12th date of each month within the period from 17.11.2001 till 17.11.2002.  I.Desjatnikovs did not issue to Natalija Iljina the copy of the cash order, did not transfer the sum of money in the amount of 7300 Lvl to the account of the pawnshop and misappropriated it.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Due to the above mentioned activities of I.Desjatnikovs the holding company - pawnshop &quot;Omega&quot; has suffered the material loss in the amount of 45000Lvl.  Natalija Iljina has suffered the material loss in the amount of 7300Lvl.&quot;  </font><br>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Thus the warrant expressly states that it refers to one offence, but it is not clear which is the offence.  Is it the initial facts relating to the three alleged occasions on which he handed out to himself cash from the cash desk of the pawnshop?  Yet there are also facts about an allegedly unrepaid loan?  I agree with the finding of the learned trial judge that it is not clear to which set of facts the one offence relates, i.e. the taking of cash or the unrepaid loan.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	On this ground alone I would have a concern in ordering the surrender of the appellant, as the situation is ambiguous.  However, my decision does not turn on this issue.</font><br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">5.	</font></b><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Obligation to surrender</font></u></b><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The relevant portion of s.10 of the European Arrest Warrant Act, 2003, &quot;the Act of 2003&quot;, provides that where a judicial authority in an issuing state issues a European arrest warrant in respect of a person against whom the State intends to bring proceedings for the offence to which the European arrest warrant relates, that person shall, subject to and in accordance with the provisions of the Act of 2003 and the Framework Decision, be arrested and surrendered to the issuing state.  This case revolves around &quot;the offence to which the European arrest warrant relates&quot;.</font><br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">6.	</font></b><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Form of the European Arrest Warrant</font></u></b><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Section 11(1) of the Act of 2003 mandates that the European arrest warrant shall in so far as it is practicable be in the form set out in the Annex to the Framework Decision and shall specify matters as set out there.  This includes, for example, the name and nationality of the person in respect of whom the European arrest warrant is issued.  As to the offence, the requirement is to specify the offence to which the European arrest warrant relates, including the nature and classification under the law of the issuing state of the offence concerned.  It is also required to specify the circumstances in which it is alleged that the offence took place, including the time and place and degree of involvement.  The penalties are required to be stated, </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">inter alia</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">.  Thus a significant amount of detail is required.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The European arrest warrant in this case is in the form set out in the Annex to the Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States, O.J. L190/1 18.7.2002.  The Framework Decision and the Annex are in Part B of the Act of 2003.  However, in parts of the European arrest warrant before the Court, where there are alternatives, an appropriate alternative is not indicated.  This makes the warrant somewhat unclear.  Paragraph (e) follows the form of paragraph (e) of the Annex to the Framework Decision.  The number of offences to which the warrant relates is stated, it is specifically stated that it is one offence.  A description is given of the circumstances.  The nature and classification of the offence is given.  The precise wording of (e) is followed and the list of offences is set out with boxes beside each offence to enable the relevant offence to be identified by a tick.</font><br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">7.	</font></b><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Three Options</font></u></b><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	In this case three options are considered as methods by which an offence may be identified as permitting the surrender of a person on a European arrest warrant.  These options are: (a) a corresponding offence; (b) an offence on the list in Article 2.2 of the Framework Decision, in paragraph (e) of the warrant, which is ticked in the appropriate box; and (c) it is submitted that, there being no box ticked on the list, the executing judicial authority in the requested state may, on the facts set out in the warrant, hold that the offence is one specified on the list.  I shall consider these three options separately.</font><br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">8.	</font></b><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">First Option - (a) a corresponding offence</font></u></b><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Pursuant to s.38 of the Act of 2003, a person shall not be surrendered to an issuing state in respect of an offence unless (a) the offence corresponds to an offence under the law of the State, and (b) under the law of the issuing state the offence is punishable by imprisonment or detention for a maximum period of not less than 12 months, or a term of imprisonment or detention of not less than 4 months has been imposed on the person in respect of the offence in the issuing state, and the person is required under the law of the issuing state to serve all or part of that term of imprisonment.  Thus the offence must be a corresponding offence with a required level of penalty.</font><br>

<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">10.	</font></b><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Definition of a corresponding offence</font></u></b><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Section 5 of the Act of 2003, as amended by s.70 of the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act, 2005, defines a corresponding offence for the purpose of the Act.  It states:-</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	&quot;...  an offence specified in a European arrest warrant corresponds to an offence under the law of the State, where the act or omission that constitutes the offence so specified would, if committed in the State on the date on which the European arrest warrant is issued, constitute an offence under the law of the State.&quot;</font><br>
<br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">11.	</font></b><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">No correspondence</font></u></b><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Quite correctly in my view, the learned High Court judge held that the court must first decide whether the acts alleged to have been done by the appellant would, if committed in Ireland on the 7th December, 2005, constitute an offence under Irish law.  If they would then there would be a corresponding offence and surrender must be ordered.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	In this case the warrant refers to a single offence of &quot;misappropriation&quot;.  It was submitted that the corresponding offence is that arising under s.4(1) of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001 and s.6 of the same Act.  Section 4(1) provides:-</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		&quot;Subject to </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">section 5</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">, a person is guilty of theft if he or she dishonestly appropriates property without the consent of its owner and with the intention of depriving its owner of it.&quot;</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The learned High Court judge pointed out that the law in this State required a dishonest intent, he reviewed the facts on the warrant and held:-</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		&quot;Each of these matters undoubtedly gives rise to a civil claim for the recovery of money by Omega in the first instance and by Ms. Iljina secondly. But can it be said that these actions by the respondent would give rise to an offence of theft under s. 4 in this State? I think not. There is no act alleged which comes within the concept of dishonesty referred to in s. 4, and that gap precludes correspondence with the offence here. In addition it seems to me that there is absent also any fact to indicate an intention on the part of the respondent to deprive Omega or Ms. Iljina of the sums in question either temporarily or permanently and this would be a necessary ingredient of the offence here. In fact the allegation in respect of the first transaction is that he left an IOU. That would not be evidence of intention to deprive the company of the money, and the second transaction was committed to writing in the form of a loan agreement. Those facts do not seem to me to correspond to an offence of theft under s.4 given the absence of dishonest intent alleged in the factual background.&quot;</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Also, the High Court held that the offence did not correspond with an offence under s.6, as there was no allegation of dishonest intent.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The High Court looked at the facts and acts alleged on the warrant, analysed whether they would constitute an offence in Ireland, and reached a conclusion.  I would affirm the finding of the High Court that there is no corresponding offence.  Consequently the first option is not applicable to this case.</font><br>

The Council may decide at any time, acting unanimously after consultation of the European Parliament under the conditions laid down in Article 39(1) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), to add other categories of offence to the list contained in paragraph 2.

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">					[the emphasis is added].</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Thus in this option the Framework Decision clearly and plainly refers to offences in the issuing Member State, as they are defined by the law of the issuing State, not requiring verification of double criminality, but giving rise to surrender.  </font><br>

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		&quot;(b) 	the offence is an offence to which paragraph 2 of Article 2 of the Framework Decision applies or is an offence that consists of conduct specified in that paragraph, and under the law of the issuing state the offence is punishable by imprisonment for a maximum period of not less than 3 years.&quot;</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	This option envisages a new approach to rendition of persons across State borders.  (i) No double-criminality is required.  (ii) It is a new development in that the descriptions of the offences are very general and somewhat vague.  They are not precise legal definitions.  (iii)  It relates to a more serious type of offence, the penalty required in the issuing state is imprisonment for a maximum period of not less than 3 years.

<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	None of the listed offences on the warrant are ticked.  The High Court found that the issuing state had not marked any of the offences contained in the list.  The High Court held, and I would affirm, that as no tick appears on the warrant in any box on the list, the legal requirements are not met, and this warrant does not meet the requirements of the second option.</font><br>

<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The High Court held that there was nothing in Article 2.2 which states that an issuing authority must tick or otherwise mark the appropriate offences on the list appearing in paragraph (e) of the warrant, the list being identical with the list set forth in Article 2.2 of the Framework Decision.  The High Court held:-</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		&quot;Article 2.2 in my view places an obligation upon the requested state to surrender in respect of offences coming within the listed offences. That obligation is not dependent upon the offence in question being ticked or otherwise marked by the issuing authority. In the present case the issuing authority has not ticked any offence, though it might very well have chosen to do so under the general heading &#8220;fraud&#8221;. The fact that the issuing authority has chosen to set forth factual details of the offences in paragraph (e) instead of ticking the offence of fraud, does not preclude this court from concluding that the facts as set forth in the warrant constitute &quot;</font><i><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">an offence that consists of conduct specified in that paragraph&quot; as provided in s. 38(1)(b)</font></u></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">.&quot;</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The High Court held that there were three options.  The learned High Court judge stated:-</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		&quot;It seems to me that the Oireachtas has provided clearly for the fulfilment of the obligations under Article 2.2 of the Framework Decision, which makes no reference to the issuing authority marking the offence or designating it as such, by requiring this Court to decide the matter in a number of alternative ways, (a) by correspondence being made out in accordance with s. 5 of the Act, (b) by the issuing authority actually nominating the offence as an Article 2.2 offence by ticking or otherwise marking the offence in the list contained in paragraph (e) of the warrant, and finally (c) by deciding whether the conduct alleged consists of conduct coming within any of the offences contained in that list, whether it has been ticked or not. Otherwise, the words &#8220;</font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">an offence that consists of conduct specified in that paragraph&#8221; </font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">appear otiose.&quot;</font><br>

<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The warrant gave a description of the facts. It provides:-</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		&quot;II.  Full description of  offence(s) not covered by section I above: Ivans Desjatnikovs, id.no. 300653-10235, being the chairman of the board of the holding company - pawnshop &quot;Omega&quot;, being the materially responsible person, in January-February 2002 handed out for his economic needs in Riga street 34, Daugavpils from the cash desk of the pawnshop sums of money in cash and up till now he had not accounted for disposal of 45000Lvl, as well as had not returned the money in the cash desk.  The power to act with the property and means of the pawnshop was delegated to I.Desjatnikovs according to Article 22 of Statutes of the holding company - pawnshop &quot;Omega&quot;.  The money was handed out by filling in the following documents:</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">			</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		-	cash expense order No. 1 from 2 January 2002 for the amount of 44000,00Lvl;</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		-	cash expense order No. 8 from 30 January 2002 for the amount of 552,15Lvl;</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		-	cash expense order No. 9 from 6 February for the amount of 516,85Lvl.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		I.Desjatnikovs has signed the mentioned orders as the materially responsible person, confirming the fact of handing out of the money from the cash desk, as well as the receiver of the money, confirming the fact of receipt of the money.  Moreover the fact of money receipt was entered in the cashbook of the pawnshop, where in pages No.1 on 2 January 2002, No.18 on 30 January 2002 and No. 22 on 6 February 2002 I.Desjatnikovs had placed his signature.  Also in pre-trial investigation it is established that Ivans Desjatnikovs, being the chairman of the board of the holding company - pawnshop &quot;Omega&quot;, in 2001, the more precise date is not established, presenting himself as an employee of the mentioned pawnshop, received money in the amount of 7300Lvl as a loan from his acquaintance Anna Greckina and undertook to pay to A.Greckina 2% of the amount monthly.  Further on I.Desjatnikovs did not fulfil his obligations.  Thereof the heir of A.Greckina's rights - her daughter Natalija Iljina, born in 1951, insisted on the official drawing up of the aforementioned loan agreement.  On 17.11.2001 I.Desjatnikovs, identifying himself as the manager of the pawnshop &quot;Omega&quot;, actually being the chairman of the board of the pawnshop, and Natalija Iljina has signed the loan agreement, according to which the creditor Natalija Iljina grants to the pawnshop &quot;Omega&quot; for a term of one year sum of money in the amount of 7300Lvl for production activities and the pawnshop undertakes to pay to Natalija Iljina monthly 2% of the amount on the 12th date of each month within the period from 17.11.2001 till 17.11.2002.   I.Desjatnikovs did not issue to Natalija Iljina the copy of the cash order, did not transfer the sum of money in the amount of 7300Lvl to the account of the pawnshop and misappropriated it.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		On 14 March 2002 I.Desjatnikovs left Latvia not fulfilling his debt commitments and had not returned till the present day.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		Due to the above mentioned activities of I.Desjatnikovs the holding company - pawnshop &quot;Omega&quot; has suffered the material loss in the amount of 45000Lvl.  Natalija Iljina has suffered the material loss in the amount of 7300Lvl.  It is established that the misappropriated money was not used in the interests of the pawnshop &quot;Omega&quot; and Natalija Iljina and that the criminal offences was committed by I.Desjatnikovs alone, he had no accomplices.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		In this way Ivans Desjatnikovs repeatedly committed illegal acquiring of property of another on a large scale, being a person to whom such property been entrusted, that is committed misappropriation - a criminal offence prescribed by Section 179 three of Criminal Law.&quot;</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The warrant then described, in optional information, other circumstances:- </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		&quot;This criminal case was initiated on 10 April 2003 in Daugavpils City and District Police office according to Section 179 Part three of Criminal Law.  The guilt of Ivans Desjatnikovs is confirmed with the statement of the Forensic department of Ministry of Interior on 29 January 2004 about documentary revision of the holding company - pawnshop &quot;Omega&quot;, opinion on 29 October 2003 of Expertise Department of Central Criminal Police of the State Police of the Ministry of Interior about performance of handwriting expertise, evidence of the victim and the victim's representative, evidence of witnesses and other case materials.  It is established that on 14 March 2002 Ivans Desjatnikovs left Latvia and had not returned till the present day.  On 15.06.2004 the decision was made to start the search of the accused I.Desjatnikovs, thereof in the Criminal Police of Daugavpils City and District Police office there was the search case No. 1180032004 initiated.  During the course of the pre-trial investigation I.Desjatnikovs was sent several writs of summons to arrive in the police and prosecutor's office, but he never arrived.  During the pre-trial investigation it is established that I. Desjatnikovs has phoned several times from Ireland to his wife Ehatennu Desjatnikova and the representative of the pawnshop in Daugavpils, explaining them that he was in Ireland, but never specified his address or whereabouts in Ireland.  From the evidence given by his wife and the representative it results that he knew that there was a criminal case initiated regarding his activities.  But I. Desjatnikovs continued to stay in the territory of Ireland.  He is in Ireland today as well.  In this case due to the afore mentioned circumstances it was not possible officially to notify I.Desjatnikovs about the measures executed against him and he was not summoned to the court session in which the question about his arrest was adjudicated accordingly.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		On 21 July 2004 the judge of Daugavpils Court rendered a judgment in absentia regarding application of a security measure - arrest to I.Desjatnikovs.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		Thus it is established during the pre-trial investigation as well during the course of search measures that I.Desjatnikovs is in Ireland, but his address is not known.&quot;</font><br>
<br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">20.	</font></b><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The Law</font></u></b><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The terms of Article 2.2 of the Framework Decision and of s.38(1) of the Act of 2003 have been set out previously in this judgment.  The issue for determination, whether or not there is a third option, depends on a construction of the law.</font><br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">21.	</font></b><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The list system</font></u></b><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The Framework Decision addressed the scope of the European arrest warrant in Article 2.  The list system is a new approach of enhanced cooperation between Member States enabling a speedier process of extradition.  This is made possible by the mutual confidence which exists between Member States.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	In contrast to the requirement of correspondence, this new list system does not require double criminality.  The executing state is not required to verify double criminality in respect of offences identified on the list of thirty two categories of offences, but the offence should be punishable by a penalty as set out in law.  The matter of penalty is not in issue in this case.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The fact that there is a precise description of the facts of the case is important, even though the issue of double criminality is not required to be considered.  It is important that there be a good description of the facts.  An arrested person is entitled to be informed of the reasons for his arrest and of any charge against him in plain language which he can understand.  Also, in view of the specialty rule, the facts upon which a warrant is based should be clearly stated.</font><br>
<br>
<br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">22.	</font></b><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Absence of requirement of double criminality</font></u></b><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The most significant change in this new list system is the absence of the requirement of double criminality.  The dispensing of the requirement for double criminality was the subject of the decision of the ECJ in </font><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Advocaten voor de Wereld VZW v. Leden van de Ministerraad</font></u></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">, (Case C 303/05) [2007] E.C.R. I -3633, where it was held:-</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		&quot;Accordingly, while Article 2(2) of the Framework Decision dispenses with verification of double criminality for the categories of offences mentioned therein, the definition of those offences and of the penalties applicable continue to be matters determined by the law of the issuing Member State, which, as is, moreover stated in Article 1(3) of the Framework Decision, must respect fundamental rights and fundamental legal principles as enshrined in Article 6 EU, and, consequently, the principle of the legality of criminal offences and penalties.&quot;</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Of the list of offences the judgments stated:-</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		&quot;With regard, first, to the choice of the 32 categories of offences listed in Article 2(2) of the Framework Decision, the Council was able to form the view, on the basis of the principle of mutual recognition and in the light of the high degree of trust and solidarity between the Member States, that, whether by reason of their inherent nature or by reason of the punishment incurred of a maximum of at least three years, the categories of offences in question feature among those the seriousness of which in terms of adversely affecting public order and public safety justifies dispensing with the verification of double criminality.  Consequently, even if one were to assume that the situation of persons suspected of having committed offences featuring on the list set out in Article 2(2) of the Framework Decision or convicted of having committed such offences is comparable to the situation of persons suspected of having committed offences other than those listed in that provision, the distinction is, in any event, objectively justified.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	With regard, second, to the fact that the lack of precision in the definition of the categories of offences in question risks giving rise to disparate implementation of the Framework Decision within the various national legal orders, suffice it to point out that it is not the objective of the Framework Decision to harmonise the substantive criminal law of the Member States and that nothing in Title VI of the EU Treaty, Articles 34 and 31 of which were indicated as forming the legal basis of the Framework Decision, makes the application of the European arrest warrant conditional on harmonisation of the criminal laws of the Member States within the area of the offences in question.&quot;</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	This upholding of the list scheme in Article 2.2, dispensing with double criminality, is relevant to both the second and third option.  It affirms a process which does not require double criminality.  I also note that, while it was not the issue of the case, the ECJ stated that the definition of the offences and of the penalties applicable continue to be matters for the law of the issuing state.</font><br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">23.	</font></b><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">High Court basis for third option</font></u></b><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The High Court based its decision on the third option on what is perceived as the lack of any specific requirement that the issuing state mark or indicate the relevant offence on the list.  The learned trial judge held that the courts in this State should decide whether the conduct alleged constitutes conduct coming within the offences on the list, whether ticked or not.  He based this decision on the words &quot;an offence that consists of conduct specified in that paragraph&quot; in s.38(1)(b) of the Act of 2003.</font><br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">24.	</font></b><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Decision on third option</font></u></b><br>
<br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">24.1</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Thus the decision on this third option requires a construction of the words of s.38(1)(b) of the Act of 2003.  These words are:-</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		&quot;(b)	the offence is an offence to which paragraph 2 of Article 2 of the Framework Decision applies or is an offence that consists of conduct specified in that paragraph, and under the law of the issuing state the offence is punishable by imprisonment for a maximum period of not less than 3 years.&quot;</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	These words are not exactly the same as those in Article 2.2 of the Framework Decision.  The Framework Decision states:-</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&quot;2. 	The following offences, if they are punishable in the issuing Member State by a custodial sentence or a detention order for a maximum period of at least three years and as they are defined by the law of the issuing Member State, shall, under the terms of this Framework Decision and without verification of the double criminality of the act, give rise to surrender pursuant to a European arrest warrant:&quot;</font>
<p></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The Framework Decision words are precise and clear.  They refer to the list of offences.  They require a specific penalty - which is more serious that that required in the correspondence option - and which is not in issue in this case.  The Framework Decision specifically refers to offences &quot;as they are defined by the law of the issuing Member State&quot;.  This is a key requirement.  The definition of the offences is a matter for the issuing state and it is specifically stated that there is no requirement of double criminality.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	This portion of the Framework Decision is transposed into Irish law by s.38(1)(b) of the Act of 2003.  The words of s.38(1)(b) are not precisely the same as those of the Framework Decision.  However, the intent of the Oireachtas is clearly expressed.  It states that it applies to an offence where &quot;the offence is an offence to which paragraph 2 of Article 2 of the Framework Decision applies&quot;.  The object of the Act of 2003 is to transpose the Framework Decision into Irish law, and this section specifically states that it covers an offence to which Article 2.2 of the Framework Decision applies.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	In s.38(1)(b) of the Act of 2003 there then follows the phrase upon which the High Court rested its decision: &quot;or is an offence that consists of conduct specified in that paragraph&quot;.  The balance of the section refers to penalty and is not in issue.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The learned High Court judge held that the third option arose on the words, &quot;or is an offence that consists of conduct specified in that paragraph&quot;, and that if such a construction was not taken the words were otiose.  Thus it is essentially a matter of construing s.38(1)(b) of the Act of 2003 and these words in the section.  However, these words cannot be taken in isolation, the fact that the Act of 2003 is the transposition into Irish law of the Framework Decision is an important factor.</font>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">24.2</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	I have sympathy for the learned trial judge in construing this Act of 2003 and applaud his perseverance in the face of the wording.  However, I respectfully disagree with his analysis of the third option.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The Irish Statute should as far as possible be construed in accordance with the Framework Decision.  </font><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Pupino</font></u></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> (Case C-105/03) [2005] E.C.R. I-5285 provides that the national court is required to take into consideration all the rules of national law and to interpret them, as far as is possible, in light of the wording and purpose of the Framework Decision.  The role of the Court is to try and reach an interpretation which is in accordance with the Framework Decision.  </font><br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">24.3</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> 	As this is essentially a matter of construing s.38(1)(b), I have found little assistance from case law elsewhere on this issue of the third option.  It may well be because of the terms of the relevant national laws.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The Act of 2003 must be read in the context of the Framework Decision.  Box (e) of the Annex contains a form of European arrest warrant.  Box (e) is headed &quot;Offences&quot;.  At I it is stated:-</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		&quot;If applicable, tick one or more of the following offences&#8230;&quot;</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Clearly this mandates a decision.  On the plain meaning of the words of the Framework Decision an exception was made to the principle of double criminality by the creation of the list system in Article 2.2.  This exception requires a decision by the issuing state, which decision requires to be communicated in the form of warrant in the Annex to the Framework Decision, which expressly requires a tick.  </font><br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">24.4</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The issue is whether the Act of 2003 has introduced a third option into the law in Ireland, in addition to the second option.  	</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	While the Framework Decision does not itself expressly require that a tick should be placed opposite the relevant offence in the box provided on the form of the warrant annexed to the Framework Decision, Article 8 of the Decision, under the heading: &quot;Content and form of the European arrest warrant, provides:-</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		'The European arrest warrant shall contain the following information set out in accordance with the form contained in the Annex:</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		&#8230;</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		(d)	the nature and legal classification of the offence, particularly in respect of Article 2;'&quot;</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Consequently this mandatory requirement refers back to the express requirement set out in the form of European arrest warrant, as set out in the previous paragraph.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	It is clear for this reason that the form of European arrest warrant annexed to the Framework Decision, which the Member States are required to follow as far as possible, does expressly require that a tick be placed against the relevant offence.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Also, inherent in the Framework Decision and the Act of 2003 is the requirement that the issuing state should identify the offence and its penalty.  This is a logical and reasonable approach as it is the law of the issuing state under which the offence exists, and on which the issuing state seeks the surrender of a person.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	There may be a degree of confusion with the situation in cases where corresponding offences are in issue.  There an Irish judge may consider the facts and acts on the warrant.  However, that approach is not to determine if it is an offence in the issuing state.  It is to determine if the facts and acts are an offence under Irish law, of which he has judicial knowledge.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	It would be an extraordinary leap, a major step, to give to an Irish High Court the role of deciding whether on the facts the warrant refers to an offence in the issuing state.  The words of Article 2.2 of the Framework Decision are clear, and they do not establish such a system.  This radical change was found by the learned High Court judge to have been introduced into Ireland by the words &quot;or is an offence that consists of conduct specified in that paragraph&quot; in s.38(1)(b) of the Act of 2003.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	It is the duty of the Court to interpret s.38(1)(b) of the Act of 2003 as far as possible in light of the wording and purpose of the Framework Decision - and to construe the Act of 2003 in accordance with the Framework Decision. </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	It appears to me that there are a number of important factors:-</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	(i)  This suggested third option would be a radical change in the law.  As such it would have to be established clearly and expressly.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	(ii)  The Oireachtas has, on the contrary, expressed a different intent, i.e. that the European arrest warrant shall be as far as practicable in the form set out in the Annex to the Framework Decision: as provided for by s.11 of the Act of 2003.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	(iii)  A decision is required of the issuing state.  The requirement of a decision by the issuing state is a matter of common sense.  If the issuing state wishes to use this new system it is required to make a decision on this option, on the list.  Once made this decision must be communicated.  The method of communicating the decision for using this list system is on the list provided, in the boxes provided.  This is not just a technicality.  This is a matter of law.  The issuing state, if it wishes to use the list system, must make the choice and tick any relevant box.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	(iv) The Annex clearly, expressly, requires that an applicable offence be ticked.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	(v)  The initial words of s.38(1)(b) simply require that the offence is an offence to which paragraph 2 of Article 2 of the Framework Decision applies.  It is a clear requirement and is not in issue.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	(vi) The words upon which the learned High Court judge rested his decision follow: &quot;or is an offence that consists of conduct specified in that paragraph.&quot;  These are ambiguous, and so should be construed in context and in view of the purpose of the Act of 2003 and the Framework Decision.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	(vii)  The meaning and effect of that phrase is difficult to decipher in light of the context and purpose of the Act of 2003 or the Framework Decision.  The offence must be an offence in the issuing state.  This refers back to the fact that the &quot;offences&quot; on the list are somewhat vague descriptions and may refer to differently named offences, or to a situation where there may in fact not be such a specific offence in the executing state, for example racketeering, racism.  The list is in terms of a political decision rather than in precise legal terms.  Also, in the vagueness of its terms it enables an issuing state to identify its offence.  There is no conduct specified in Article 2.2 which could be said to determine whether an offence stated in a warrant is an offence listed in that Article.  That is something which only the issuing state can do, by reference to its own national law.  That is why, as I have pointed out, the Act of 2003 and the Framework Decision require that the European arrest warrant should follow the form contained in the Annex to the Decision.  Article 8 requires the issuing state to classify the offence, in particular for the purpose of Article 2.  If an issuing state does not classify the offence, it is not open to a court in the executing state to determine, for the purposes of a European arrest warrant, whether an offence in the warrant is an offence to which Article 2.2 applies, unless the executing state states that this is so by ticking the relevant box.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	(viii)  I am satisfied that the learned High Court judge erred in determining that there was a third option, and consequently an order may not be made directing the surrender of the appellant on this European arrest warrant.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	(ix)  Once again this case illustrates the difficulty in construing the Act of 2003.  As Fennelly J. stated in </font><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Dundon v. Governor of Cloverhill Prison</font></u></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> [2006] 2 IR 518, at 545:-</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		&quot; It has to be acknowledged, at once, that the legislation presents unusual problems of interpretation. The European arrest warrant is itself a novel instrument. It was adopted in the wake of the devastatingly tragic events of the 11th September, 2001. The drafting is extraordinarily loose and vague, particularly in the manner in which offences are defined.&quot;</font><br>
<br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">25.	</font></b><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Conclusion</font></u></b><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	In conclusion, and to recapitulate, at issue in this case is whether there are two options for identifying offences for which a person may be surrendered under s.16 of the European Arrest Warrant Act, 2003, on a European arrest warrant, i.e. on the basis that it is a corresponding offence, or by ticking a box in the relevant portion of the European arrest warrant.  Or, whether there is a third option under which a court of a requested state, i.e. the executing state, may look at the facts, find that it is not a corresponding offence, but find that the offence is an offence of the issuing state even though it has not been identified on the list by the issuing state by a tick or otherwise, but conclude that there is such an offence in the issuing state and that it comes within the list system.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The Framework Decision and the Act of 2003 have introduced a novel system.  First, the concept of double criminality, a corresponding offence, may be applied.  This is the basis upon which extradition has proceeded for many years and is not a new concept.  However, secondly, the concept of a list of offences, where double criminality need not be found, is an entirely new system, agreed by the Member States in Article 2.2 of the Framework Decision and transposed into our law by the Act of 2003.  If the offence is identified by the issuing state then the matter comes within this new legal scheme.  However, if the offence is not identified on the list by the issuing state, the role of the requested state, as submitted in this case on behalf of the State, would be an extraordinary step.  It would require an Irish Court to look behind the issuing authority, and its decision, and decide whether the act described is an offence under the law of the issuing state, and whether it comes within the list of offences in Article 2.2.  For the reasons given I am satisfied that the Act of 2003 does not create this third option.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Section 38(1)(b) of the Act of 2003 is the implementation of Article 2.2 of the Framework Decision.  If this option is applied by an issuing state then one or more of the offences require to be ticked or marked on the European arrest warrant.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Section 38(1)(b) of the Act of 2003 states the law on corresponding offences.  Correspondence is addressed in Article 2.4 of the Framework Decision.  Paragraph (e) II of the arrest warrant relates to offences not covered by Article 2.2 and was completed on the warrant in issue in this case.  This enables a decision on whether or not there is a corresponding offence.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	As the High Court held, and which I would affirm, there is no corresponding offence in this jurisdiction.  It is clear that there is no corresponding offence and so the appellant could not be extradited for the offence on that basis.  Nor could he be extradited on the basis of the list system, as no tick or mark was made by the issuing state in paragraph (e) I in the list of offences.  There is no third option by which an Irish court could go behind the warrant, consider the facts, and determine that under the law of the issuing state the offence is an offence in the issuing state and that it is one listed in paragraph (e) I, when an issuing state has not made such a decision or ticked a relevant box.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	For the reasons given I would allow the appeal.  I am satisfied that an order may not be made directing the surrender of the appellant on this European arrest warrant.</font><br>
