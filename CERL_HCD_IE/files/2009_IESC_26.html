<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">1.	This is an application by Thomas Talbot, the plaintiff/appellant, hereinafter referred to as &quot;the appellant&quot;.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">2.	The appellant has brought a notice of motion and a notice of vacation to this Court.  He seeks to appeal the whole of the final order of this Court made on the 30th November, 2007.  </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">3.	On the 30th November, 2007, the Supreme Court (Hardiman J., Geoghegan J, and Finnegan J.) heard a motion of the appellant seeking to dismiss the appeal from a motion of the High </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Court of the first and third named respondents, for delay.  The Supreme Court ordered that the appellant's motion be struck out and that he pay to the respondents the costs of the motion.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">4.	This motion arises in proceedings brought by the appellant against the respondents.  The appellant is a member of the first respondent, a golf club.  In his proceedings he is suing the golf club, </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">the Golfing Union of Ireland and a former handicap secretary of the golf club (the third named respondent), seeking damages arising out of events surrounding the regulation of the appellant's golf </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">handicap.  The primary relief sought by the appellant is damages for defamation, although other causes of action are also pleaded.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">5.	The motion in issue arose in interlocutory proceedings of the action by the appellant. </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">5.1	The first and third named respondents issued a notice for particulars seeking answers to various questions arising out of the three documents comprising the statement of claim of the appellant.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">5.2	In March, 2007 the High Court (Hanna J.) refused an application on behalf of the respondents, by notice of motion, seeking to compel the appellant to deliver replies to particulars.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">5.3	The first and third named respondent appealed that order of the High Court to the Supreme Court.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">5.4	While the appeal was pending before the Supreme Court, on the 25th April, 2007, the appellant served a notice of trial in the High Court.  The first and third named respondents wrote to the appellant pointing out that the matter was not ready for trial.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">5.5	The first and third named respondent brought a motion to have the notice of trial set aside.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">5.6	On the 30th July, 2007, the High Court (Murphy J.) made an order setting aside the notice of trial.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">5.7	By notice of motion dated 26th November, 2007, the appellant applied to the Supreme Court to dismiss the appeal relating to replies to particulars, and for an order reinstating his notice of trial.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">5.8	The motion came on for hearing before the Supreme Court on the 30th November, 2007.  The Supreme Court (Hardiman J., Geoghegan J. and Finnegan J.) ordered that the motion be struck out and awarded costs against the appellant.  The Supreme Court noted that the appeal by the respondents from Hanna J.'s judgment, concerning replies to notice for particulars, was awaiting a date for hearing.  The Court indicated that it could not dismiss the appeal by motion unless it was manifestly vexatious or stood no reasonable chance of success.  The Court did not accept that either applied.  Also, there had been no appeal of the striking out of the notice of trial.  However, that was not necessary.  The appellant could apply for a new notice of trial when the case was ready for hearing.  There may have been a misunderstanding by the appellant that his proceedings had been struck out, which they were not.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">6.	The appellant seeks to vacate the final order of the Supreme Court of the 30th November, 2007.  The appellant lists the following matters as grounding his motion for vacation of the final order:-</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	 &quot;1	Fair adversarial divining of merits of my five page sworn affidavit neglected by the Court set aside in unjudicial inquisitorial proceedings on 30 Nov 07.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	2	On 30 Nov, 2007 clear perception of subjective bias on the part of Judges Hardiman, Geoghegan, Finnegan  and Assistant Reg Mary O'Donoghue</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	3 	Defendants submission directed by Chief Justice JLM on 25/10/07 assailed by my counter submission and sworn affidavit assisted by motion and paginated index all agreed for 30 Nov 07 date for hearing fixed in office</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	4	Were ignored by Judges these pleadings that would put me in an unassailable position going as far as to prevent me even referring to them</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	5	Judges did not strike out but deferred to another day my application No 3 of motion to dismiss their appeal of H.C. orders duly confined me to issue of Part 2 Notice of Trial yet orders conversely and falsely ignore this instead upholding their appeal of High Court orders and I pay costs?&quot;</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">7.	The appellant deposed a five page affidavit with forty eight paragraphs and many documents in support of his application.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">8.	I have read carefully the documents filed by the appellant, and I have had the benefit of hearing his oral submissions.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">9.	The appellant's primary allegation is of bias of the Supreme Court.  He returned several times to the argument that his case was unassailable and that the order of the Supreme Court </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">evidenced its bias.  He stressed his belief that the High Court (Hanna J.) had not erred.  He submitted that the very strength of his case would prove bias.  He referred to and relied upon </font><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Kenny </font></u></b><br>
<br>
<b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">v. Trinity College &amp; Anor</font></u></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> [2007] I.E.S.C. 42.  </font><br>
<br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">10.	</font><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Law on Jurisdiction</font></u></b><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	I have considered in detail the law relating to an application to vacate a final order of the Supreme Court in my judgment delivered today in </font><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Talbot v. McCann Fitzgerald &amp; ors</font></u></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">.  Appeal No.114/2006.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">11.	The appellant seeks to vacate a final order of this Court.  In principle an order of the Supreme Court is final and conclusive:  See Article 34.4.6 Constitution of Ireland,  </font><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Belville Holdings </font></u></b><br>
<br>
<b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Ltd v. Revenue Commissioners</font></u></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> [1994] 1 I.L.R.M. 29 at pp.36-38; </font><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">McG v. D.W. (No.2) (Joinder of Attorney General)</font></u></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> [2000] 4 I.R. 1; </font><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Attorney General v. Open Door </font></u></b><br>
<br>
<b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Counselling Ltd (No.2)</font></u></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> [1994] 2 I.R. 333; </font><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In re Greendale Developments Ltd (No.3)</font></u></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> [2000] 2 I.R. 514; </font><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Bula Ltd v. Tara Mines Ltd (No.6)</font></u></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> [2000] 4 I.R. 412.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">12.	The fundamental principle is that an order of the Supreme Court is final and conclusive.  It may be varied under the slip rule or to ensure that the order reflects the intended order of the </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Court.  New proceedings may be brought if an order has been achieved by fraud.  In extremely rare and exceptional cases the Court has an inherent jurisdiction to vary an order of the Court to </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">protect constitutional rights and justice.  There is a very heavy onus on a person requesting the Supreme Court to engage such jurisdiction to establish a high degree of exceptional circumstances.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">13.	 Thus the appellant must establish that (a) the circumstances of this case are so exceptional as to give rise to this jurisdiction; and (b) if the jurisdiction arises, that there was reason to exercise </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">it, such as bias.  </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">14.	The appellant is seeking the exercise of this exceptional jurisdiction of the Court to vacate the order of the 30th November, 2007 striking out his motion to dismiss on grounds </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">inter alia</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> of </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">delay the appeal of the first and third named respondents from the order of the High Court (Hanna J.) refusing to compel the appellant to give replies to particulars sought.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">15.	I have read the papers filed, and considered them, and I have had the benefit of the appellant's oral submissions.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">16.	The appellant feels very strongly that his motion to dismiss the respondents' appeal from the order of the High Court refusing to require him to answer particulars in the action had a very </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">good basis.  He asserts that there was personal bias of the judges against him.  It is clear that the appellant considers he should have been given time to open the 18 points on his affidavit on this </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">motion.  He referred to acts of conspiracy.  He makes assertions over a wide range of topics.  However, no factual or legal foundations were established.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">17.	The appellant has not met the heavy burden required in such circumstances to raise this exceptional jurisdiction.  He has not proved rare and exceptional circumstances such as would give </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">rise to the jurisdiction to intervene in a final order of the Supreme Court.  In the circumstances of this case no such jurisdiction arises.  The appellant has failed to disclose any objective basis for </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">the exercise of this exceptional jurisdiction.  The claim is manifestly ill-founded.  Thus I would dismiss his case on the basis that the Court lacks jurisdiction to proceed.  </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">18.	However, even if jurisdiction did arise, which I am satisfied it does not, the appellant has not proved grounds upon which this Court could exercise that jurisdiction.  </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">19.	His submissions and assertions do not establish a basis for intervention, nor do they establish objective bias.  Attendance at the same schools by judges and lawyers does not establish </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">objective bias.  Having a spouse, who many years before was a member of a law firm which is a respondent in a case, does not establish objective bias by a judge.  Having advised persons as </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">clients previously does not prove objective bias.  The decision of a court on its merits, with which a litigant does not agree, does not establish objective bias.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">20.	The appellant sought to rely on </font><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Kenny v. Trinity College Dublin &amp; Anor</font></u></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> [2007] I.E.S.C. 4.  I would distinguish the facts of this case from </font><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Kenny</font></u></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">.  That case related to the issue of the </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">perception of bias, applying the objective test, arising out of a family connection between the judge who delivered the judgment and a member of a firm of architects retained as an expert </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">witness.  No such issue arises here.  This case is more similar to </font><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Bula Ltd v. Tara Mines Ltd (No.6)</font></u></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> [2000] 4 I.R. 412.  That case held that the test was whether an ordinary reasonable </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">member of the public would have a reasonable apprehension that an appellant would not have a fair hearing before an impartial judge.  It was pointed out that barristers were independent and </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">did not become espoused to a litigant's ambitions in providing the litigant with legal services.  The reasonable person would be aware of that.  Similarly, a solicitor does not espouse his client's </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">ambitions.  There must be additional factors establishing a cogent and rational link and its capacity to influence.  In that case the application was dismissed.  </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">21.	I am satisfied that the appellant has not established that an ordinary reasonable member of the public would have a reasonable apprehension that he did not have a fair hearing before the </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Supreme Court on the 30th November, 2007.  I would dismiss his application on this basis also.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">22.	In fact the appeal in relation to the notice for particulars, which the appellant sought to stop by his motion which was heard on the 30th November, 2007, has been heard and determined.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">23.	On the 29th February, 2008 the motion by the first and third named respondents appealing from the judgment of the High Court (Hanna J.), refusing to compel the appellant to reply to </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">particulars, was heard.  The appeal was allowed in part.  It was held that the appellant should reply to certain matters as stated in the order.  While this order was not referred to in the original </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">notice of motion, and could not have been because of its date, and it forms no part of this application, however, it provides the up to date situation.  The appellant did refer to it in oral </font><br>
