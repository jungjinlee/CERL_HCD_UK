</div><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">JUDGMENT of Mr. Justice Kearns delivered the 10th day of June, 2008 </font></u></b><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The applicant in this case is a married man and father of three children who lives in a rural part of Ireland. He was charged in 2001 on a single indictment containing six counts of sexual assault, three involving the complainant, TL, and three involving her cousin, SL. TL was born in 1980 and the offences involving her are alleged to have occurred in 1993. The applicant is the husband of TL&#8217;s aunt and TL did babysitting work for the two children of the applicant and his wife at that time. TL alleges that on occasions when she slept over in the applicant&#8217;s house he would come into the bedroom where she shared a bed with his children and would interfere with her under the bedclothes. He would touch her in the vaginal area and insert his fingers into her. This is said to have happened a number of times. SL was born in 1982 and the offences involving her are said to have occurred between 1994 and 1997. She also performed babysitting duties and made similar accusations to those made by TL. Both complainants came forward in 2001. The matter was first listed before the local Circuit Court judge on 30th October, 2002. The applicant successfully applied on 6th November, 2002 for separate trials in respect of each complainant. The first trial in the local Circuit Court commenced on 7th November, 2002, but on the following day the jury was discharged because defence counsel had confused certain factual matters in relation to the first complainant with particulars which related to the other complainant. The retrial of the applicant in relation to the first complainant took place in March, 2003 and resulted in a not guilty verdict from the jury in respect of all counts.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">          The trial in respect of SL commenced on 3rd July, 2003 and on 4th July, 2003 the jury disagreed on all counts. A retrial followed in March, 2004 when the jury returned a not guilty verdict on count 3 and disagreed in respect of counts 1 and 2.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	As the second named respondent proposed to put the applicant on trial for a third time in respect of counts 1 and 2 in relation to SL, the applicant brought judicial review proceedings seeking an order of prohibition by way of a permanent injunction restraining the second named respondent from taking any further steps to retry the applicant. The grounds upon which relief was sought may be summarised as follows:-</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(a)	The decision of the second named respondent to retry the applicant when he had previously been tried twice in respect of the same offence was a violation of the applicant&#8217;s right to a fair trial pursuant to Article 38 of the Constitution.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(b)	A retrial of the applicant would violate the applicant&#8217;s right to a fair hearing pursuant to Article 6 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms as adopted in this jurisdiction by the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(c)	A retrial of the applicant on the charges in respect of which he had already been tried on two previous occasions was contrary to a rule of practice of long standing.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(d)	A retrial of the applicant on the charges in respect of which he had already been tried on two previous occasions was oppressive to the applicant and amounted to an abuse of process.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In an affidavit sworn on behalf of the applicant by Joseph Cuddigan, his solicitor, the deponent states that the continual retrials of the applicant have caused great hardship to him and to his family. The applicant is a married man with three children, the eldest of whom recently completed secondary education. This daughter is alleged to have performed poorly in her Leaving Certificate examination as a result of the stress engendered as a result of the ongoing trials. Further, the deponent states that the applicant&#8217;s wife became anxious and depressed and was obliged to take anti-depressant drugs. It is further stated that the applicant&#8217;s domestic and social life suffered greatly as a result of the ongoing trial processes, to such a degree that in September, 2004, the applicant attended a consultant psychiatrist who diagnosed that both the applicant and his family were suffering from extreme stress as a result of the ongoing court proceedings. A medical report from Dr. Jane O&#8217;Neill, dated 5th July, 2004, which outlined the effects of the stress on the applicant&#8217;s children, was also exhibited in the affidavit.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Leave to bring judicial review proceedings was granted by order of the High Court (McKechnie J.) on 18th October, 2004. A statement of opposition was filed in January, 2005. The main grounds of opposition may be summarised as follows:-</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(a)	The decision of the second named respondent to try or retry the applicant is not, save in the most exceptional and limited circumstances, susceptible to relief by way of judicial review.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(b)	It is denied that the decision of the second respondent to retry the applicant is either a violation of the applicant&#8217;s right to a fair trial pursuant to Article 38 of the Constitution, or his right to a fair hearing pursuant to Article 6 of the European Convention.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(c)	It is further denied that any such retrial would be contrary to a rule of practice of long standing; alternatively, if there is such a rule of practice, it is denied that any such rule precludes the second respondent from exercising his statutory prosecutorial function.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(d)	It is further denied that a retrial would be oppressive to the applicant or an abuse of process or that the applicant is entitled to the relief he claimed or to any relief.</font><br>
<br>
<b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">JUDGMENT OF THE HIGH COURT</font></u></b><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The High Court (O&#8217;Neill J.) by judgment and order delivered on 16th October, 2006 restrained the second named respondent from taking any further steps to prosecute or retry the applicant. O&#8217;Neill J. invoked the principle of double jeopardy to hold that the correct balance between protecting the public right to a full and fair opportunity to prosecute to a verdict by a jury while at the same time guarding against the inherent dangers of repeated trials was correctly achieved by limiting the number of trials which might be had, and which end in jury disagreement, to two trials. He further held, where two juries in separate trials failed to reach a verdict because they disagreed, that the public interest had been adequately protected and that a third trial of a person for the same offence would not be a trial in due course of law as required by Article 38.1 of the Constitution. The learned trial judge found that, beyond two such trials, the risk of an innocent person being convicted became </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;unacceptable&#8221;.</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> The risk, as he saw it, arose from:-</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(a)	The potential for the </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;adjustment of evidence&#8221;</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> where it was seen to have been inadequate in the previous trials, and</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(b)	The potential prejudicial notoriety that would inevitably be attached to an accused person the more often he is tried for the same offence.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	He found that this latter factor had greater weight in the instant case because all of the potential witnesses came from the same rural area and the trial was scheduled to take place locally. The learned trial judge also took into account the fact that the applicant had previously been tried twice in respect of similar allegations made by a different complainant, TL, characterising the proposed retrial as a &#8220;</font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">fifth trial&#8221;</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">. </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	He concluded :-</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	&#8220;I have come to the conclusion therefore that the ancient common law prohibition on multiple trials known as the double jeopardy principle has application to this case, although it might more aptly be described as the triple jeopardy principle.</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	It follows that a third trial of a person for the same offence where in the two previous trials the jury had disagreed would not in my opinion be a trial in due course of law as required by Article 38(1) of the Constitution.&#8221;</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<br>
<b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">RELEVANT LEGAL PRINCIPLES</font></u></b><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	In reaching his conclusion in this matter, the learned High Court judge derived what he described as </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;assistance and enlightenment&#8221;</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> from the American jurisprudence on the topic of double jeopardy. He identified two strands of thought from decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court on the issue:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	&#8220;Firstly a clear sense of the dangers involved in putting a person on trial for the same offence repeatedly and secondly a strong sense of the public right to have a full and fair opportunity to prosecute a person in respect of an alleged crime all the way to a verdict from a jury.&#8221;</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	He described how no case had been opened to him from the United States in which there had been consideration of the problem posed by a third trial for the same offence. He took the view that the overall philosophy evident from his review of the cases was one which leans against multiple trials for the same offence, subject to an exception that where the first trial was aborted as a matter of </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;necessity&#8221; </font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">the public should not thereby be deprived of their full and fair opportunity to have a case prosecuted to verdict by a jury.</font><br>
<br>
<b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Position in the United States</font></u></b><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Having regard to the importance attached by the learned trial judge to American jurisprudence on the issue of double jeopardy, a brief consideration of the law in that jurisdiction is appropriate. Any such consideration must commence with the 5th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution which provides:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	</font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb&#8221;. </font></i></ul>
</ul>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	As Justice Black pointed out in </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Green v United States</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">, 355 U.S. 184, 187 (1957):-</font>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;The constitutional prohibition against &#8216;double jeopardy&#8217; was designed to protect an individual from being subjected to the hazards of trial and possible conviction more than once for an alleged offense. In his Commentaries, which greatly influenced the generation that adopted the Constitution, Blackstone recorded:</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8216;&#8230;the plea of autrefois acquit, or a former acquittal, is          grounded on this universal maxim of the common law of England, that no man is to be brought into jeopardy of his life more than once for the same offence&#8217;</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">            </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">United States v. Perez</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> 22 U.S. 579 (1824) is still the landmark case on the interpretation of the Constitutional provision. It was a case in which the jury disagreed following the trial of Joseph Perez for a capital offence and were discharged by the court. The prisoner&#8217;s counsel claimed that this outcome, arrived at without his consent, was a bar to any future trial for the same offence. The U.S. Supreme Court, however, disagreed, Justice Story stating as follows in the course of his opinion:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	</font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;We think, that in all cases of this nature, the law has invested Courts of justice with the authority to discharge a jury from giving any verdict, whenever, in their opinion, taking all the circumstances into consideration, there is a manifest necessity for the act or the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated.  &#8230; we are of opinion, that such a discharge constitutes no bar to further proceedings, and gives no right of exemption to the prisoner from being again put upon trial.&#8221; </font></i></ul>
</ul>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	In these circumstances the &#8216;jeopardy&#8217; is seen as continuing until the process ends in acquittal or conviction. The general rule therefore is that retrial of the defendant is not barred where a mistrial occurs. The general rule is subject to a number of exceptions, one being that no retrial will be directed where the jury is discharged because of evidentiary insufficiency. The State must endeavour to put its best foot forward when prosecuting and not call time on a trial when sufficient evidence has not been mustered to satisfy a jury of guilt. Nor may the prosecution look to the trial process as a means of gathering material for a second bite of the cherry. Where such behaviour is identified the principle of double jeopardy may be invoked in the United States to prevent the further prosecution of a defendant.</font><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Burks v United States</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> 437 U.S. 1 (1978), the Supreme Court made clear that reversal for trial error, as distinguished from evidentiary insufficiency, does not constitute a decision to the effect that the Government has failed to prove its case. The court stated at p.15:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	&#8220;As such, it implies nothing with respect to the guilt or innocence of the defendant. Rather, it is a determination that a defendant has been convicted through a judicial process which is defective in some fundamental respect, e.g., incorrect receipt or rejection of evidence, incorrect instructions, or prosecutorial misconduct. When this occurs, the accused has a strong interest in obtaining a fair readjudication of his guilt free from error, just as society maintains a valid concern for insuring that the guilty are punished.&#8221;</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Turning specifically to the issue of a retrial where a jury has disagreed, the U.S. Supreme Court addressed this issue in the context of double jeopardy in </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Richardson v. United States</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> 468 U.S. 317 (1984), when Rehnquist J in delivering the opinion of the court stated at pp.323 and 324:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	&#8220;The case law dealing with the application of the prohibition against placing a defendant twice in jeopardy following a mistrial because of a hung jury has its own sources and logic. It has been established for 160 years, since the opinion of Justice Story in United States v. Perez, 9 Wheat. 579 (1824), that a failure of the jury to agree on a verdict was an instance of &#8216;manifest necessity&#8217; which permitted a trial judge to terminate the first trial and retry the defendant, because &#8216;the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated&#8217;. Since that time we have had occasion to examine the application of double jeopardy principles to mistrials granted for reasons other than the inability of the jury to agree &#8230;  Nevertheless, we have constantly adhered to the rule that a retrial following a &#8216;hung jury&#8217; does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. Logan v United States, 144 U.S. 263. 297-298 (1892). Explaining our reasons for this conclusion in Arizona v. Washington, 434 U.S. 497 (1978), we said:-</font></i>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	&#8216;Without exception, the courts have held that the trial judge may discharge a genuinely deadlocked jury and require the defendant to submit to a second trial. This rule accords recognition to society&#8217;s interest in giving the prosecution one complete opportunity to convict those who have violated its laws&#8217;.</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	We are entirely unwilling to uproot this settled line of cases by extending the reasoning of Burks, which arose out of an appellate finding of insufficiency of evidence to convict following a jury verdict of guilty, to a situation where the jury is unable to agree on a verdict. Thirty-five years ago we said in Wade v. Hunter, </font></i><i><u><font size="4" color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman">336 U. S. 684</font></u></i><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">, </font></i><i><u><font size="4" color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman">688</font></u></i><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">-689 (1949):</font></i>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8216;The double-jeopardy provision of the Fifth Amendment, however, does not mean that every time a defendant is put to trial before a competent tribunal, he is entitled to go free if the trial fails to end in a final judgment. Such a rule would create an insuperable obstacle to the administration of justice in many cases in which there is no semblance of the type of oppressive practices at which the double-jeopardy prohibition is aimed. There may be unforeseeable circumstances that arise during a trial making its completion impossible, such as the failure of a jury to agree on a verdict. In such event the purpose of law to protect society from those guilty of crimes frequently would be frustrated by denying courts power to put the defendant to trial again. . .   What has been said is enough to show that a defendant's valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal must in some instances be subordinated to the public's interest in fair trials designed to end in just judgments.&#8217; &#8221;</font></i></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">He later continued:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;&#8230; we hold on the authority of these cases that the failure of the jury to reach a verdict is not an event which terminates jeopardy. Our holding in Burks established only that an appellate court's finding of insufficient evidence to convict on appeal from a judgment of conviction is, for double jeopardy purposes, the equivalent of an acquittal; it obviously did not establish, consistently with cases such as Perez</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">,</font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> that a hung jury is the equivalent of an acquittal.  Justice Holmes' aphorism that &#8216;a page of history is worth a volume of logic&#8217; sensibly applies here, and we reaffirm the proposition that a trial court's declaration of a mistrial following a hung jury is not an event that terminates the original jeopardy to which petitioner was subjected.&#8221; </font></i></ul>
</ul>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The learned trial judge in the present case attached some considerable importance to the case I have already mentioned, namely </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Green v. United States</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> 355 U.S. 184 (1957).</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">That was a case where the petitioner was indicted and tried in a Federal Court for first degree murder. The judge instructed the jury that it could find him guilty of either first degree murder or second degree murder. The jury found him guilty of second degree murder and its verdict was silent on the charge of first degree murder. The trial judge accepted the verdict, entered judgment, dismissed the jury and sentenced the petitioner to imprisonment. On appeal, his conviction was reversed and the case was remanded for a new trial. On remand the petitioner was tried again for first degree murder on the original indictment, convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death, notwithstanding his plea of former jeopardy. The court held that the petitioners second trial for first degree murder placed him in jeopardy twice for the same offence in violation of the Fifth Amendment, holding that his jeopardy for first degree murder came to an end when the jury was discharged at the conclusion of his first trial and that he could not be retried for that offence.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Clearly that case turned on very special facts, because the jury&#8217;s verdict, as was noted by the court at p.190, could be seen </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;as an implicit acquittal on the charge of first degree murder&#8221;</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">. As was stated by Black J. at p.191:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;&#8230;the result in this case need not rest alone on the assumption, which we believe legitimate, that the jury for one reason or another acquitted Green of murder in the first degree. For here, the jury was dismissed without returning any express verdict on that charge and without Green's consent. Yet it was given a full opportunity to return a verdict and no extraordinary circumstances appeared which prevented it from doing so. Therefore it seems clear, under established principles of former jeopardy, that Green's jeopardy for first degree murder came to an end when the jury was discharged so that he could not be retried for that offense. Wade v Hunter, 336 U.S. 684. In brief, we believe this case can be treated no differently, for purposes of former jeopardy, than if the jury had returned a verdict which expressly read: &#8216;We find the defendant not guilty of murder in the first degree but guilty of murder in the second degree.&#8217;&#8221;</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Thus, far from there being a philosophy which leans against multiple trials for the same offence in the U.S., the true position appears to be that there is no impediment in the U.S. to a number of trials taking place for the same offence, providing they do not fall into one of the exceptional categories outlined above. It has never been in doubt that a defendant can be tried a second time for an offence where his prior conviction for that same offence is set aside on appeal (</font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Ball v.</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">United States </font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">163 U.S. 662 (1896)). One recalls also the notorious case of </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Williams v. State of Georgia </font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">258 Ga. 305, 369 S.E.2d 232 (1988) &#8211; recounted so fully in John Berendt&#8217;s novel </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8216;Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil&#8217; (Random House, New York, 1994) </font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">- in which Jim Williams was convicted twice in successive jury trials of the murder of Danny Hansforth in his home in Savannah in 1981. These convictions were quashed on each occasion by the Georgia Supreme Court. His third trial resulted in a jury disagreement and ultimately Williams was acquitted by a jury when tried at a different location for the fourth time. An effort to invoke the double jeopardy rule before the Supreme Court of Georgia following the third trial failed. In delivering the judgment of that court Marshall C.J. stated (at p.6):-</font>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;It has been recognised in many cases that the primary purpose     underlying the Double Jeopardy Clause is to prohibit the retrial of a</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">criminal defendant where the prosecution has, at the initial trial, produced insufficient evidence to sustain a conviction. E.g., Burks v United States, 437 U.S. 1, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 57 L.Ed.2d 1 (1978); Hall v State, 244 Ga. 86 (5), 259 S.E. 2d 41 (1979). The general rule is that retrial of the defendant is not barred where reversal of the conviction results from trial error rather than evidentiary insufficiency.&#8221;</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">       	Counsel for the respondent has also referred to a decision of the Court of Appeals in </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">United States v. Gunter</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> (United States Courts of Appeals, Tenth Circuit, 546 F.2d 861 (1976)) where that court held that defendants could be tried a third time for the same offence where juries in previous trials were unable to agree upon verdicts and mistrials were properly declared. In that case and having reviewed the various authorities, including </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Perez</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">, Judge McWilliams stated at 866:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	</font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;Certainly the rationale of Perez and the other cases cited would not preclude a third trial where the first and second trials both resulted in mistrials based on the fact of a hung jury. Indeed the rationale of Perez suggests to us the propriety of a third trial where the prior juries were unable to agree upon a verdict. This assumes, of course, that the concept of &#8216;manifest necessity&#8217; and &#8216;ends of public justice&#8217; referred to in Perez are met. Here, in the first trial of the matter, eight defendants were brought to trial in a single trial, with each defendant apparently having separate counsel. In such circumstances some jury confusion would appear to be inevitable. The same situation prevailed at the second trial. Here, however, two defendants, Myers and Lambe, were convicted. Bringing the six remaining defendants to a third trial would appear to us to meet the conditions of Perez concerning manifest necessity and public interest. </font></i><i><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">There indeed may be a breaking point, but we do not believe it was reached in the instant case.&#8221;</font></u></i><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> </font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(Emphasis added).</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Interestingly, the court indicated that had the trial court abused its discretion when discharging the jury and declaring a mistrial, it might have reached a different conclusion. The reference to reaching a &#8216;</font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">breaking point&#8217;</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> is however of importance to the issue under consideration in this case and is a matter to which I shall return later.</font><br>
<br>
<b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Position in England &amp; Wales</font></u></b><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The position in Britain in relation to a retrial after a hung jury is quite different. Firstly, there is of course no constitutional provision governing the issue. Historically, as Blackstone noted (</font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Blackstone&#8217;s Commentaries on the Laws of England</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">, Vol. 3 (1769) 376 in Morrison (ed.), (Cavendish, London, 2001), p.295), a trial judge had the power to </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">compel</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> a jury to reach a verdict in so far that the judge could direct that the jury be moved by cart from town to town around the circuit until it reached a verdict. This created enormous difficulties. Before the Criminal Justice Act 1967, a jury verdict had to be unanimous. Section 13 of that Act, as later amended,  provided for a majority verdict ten to two, ten to one or nine to one if there were less than ten jurors, if all the original jury members remain until the end of the trial.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	An article written by Professor M. Cohen from the University of Sheffield </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;Retrial After a Hung Jury&#8221;</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> 12 </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Anglo-American Law Review</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> 174 (1983) contains a useful summary, at p.177, of the position in the neighbouring jurisdiction with regard to retrials following jury disagreement:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	</font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;According to Archbold, &#8216;&#8230; in the event of the second jury disagreeing, it is a common practice for the prosecution formally to offer no evidence&#8217;.. The Home Secretary, Mr Brooke, on the Report stage of the Criminal Appeal Bill 1964 said: &#8216;Nobody is in doubt &#8230; that when two successive juries have failed to agree it is the normal practice for the prosecution to offer no evidence, so that the case falls and the man is acquitted.&#8217; As for the writers, Daniel Devlin states: &#8216;Should the second jury disagree, the prosecution at the third trial will usually offer no evidence&#8217;. Arguile states: &#8216;If the jury fails to agree after two trials the prosecution in practice offers no evidence at the third trial&#8217;. Professor Friedland states: &#8216;It is a rule of practice in England that the accused would not be retried after the jury fail to agree on two occasions&#8217; and Lord Patrick Devlin states: &#8216;&#8230; it is almost conventional now to accept a second disagreement as tantamount to an acquittal and to drop the prosecution&#8217;.  No disagreement then on the general practice, which is borne out by two cases reported in 1963, in which the prosecution offered no evidence after two jury disagreements.</font></i><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	</font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">But the question remains whether it is legally permissible to try a defendant a third or subsequent time. The Attorney General in 1964 said: &#8216;I think that there is power to have any number of retrials following any number of disagreements&#8217;. The power to retry after a jury has been discharged for any reason, including a disagreement, was a matter of some uncertainty until the middle of the nineteenth century. It then became established by a number of cases, the main one being Winsor, that a retrial after a discharge for disagreement was permissible. However, it is interesting to note that none of the four judges in that case on the hearing before the Queens Bench, and each gave a full and considered judgment, suggested that there could be more than one retrial. Further, when affirming the decision of the Queen&#8217;s Bench, Erle CJ giving judgment on behalf of the seven members of the Exchequer Chamber, also made no reference to the possibility of more than one retrial.</font></i><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	</font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">It is submitted that it should not be inferred from the various writers&#8217; statements (to the effect) that the practice is to have no more than one retrial, that there is in law the power to have more than one.&#8221;</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The author thereafter proceeds to argue that </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;the practice is indeed the law&#8221; </font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">and that the Attorney General had no authority for his opinion that there could be any number of retrials.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Multiple trials of a person for the same offence were considered in the context of &#8220;abuse of process&#8221; by the Court of Appeal in the case of </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">R. v Henworth</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> [2001] 2 Cr. App. R. 4. In that case the appellant was charged with one count of murder. He was convicted but had his conviction set aside by the Court of Appeal whereupon a retrial occurred which resulted in a hung jury. A second retrial then began in which the appellant conducted his own defence. Owing to difficulties in the conduct of his defence the jury was discharged. A further retrial then took place and the appellant was convicted. He appealed against conviction and argued that the convention which provided that if a jury disagreed on two occasions the prosecution would not seek a further trial should also apply to the circumstances of this case where the jury on the first occasion convicted.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The Court of Appeal held, however, that when a serious crime is committed and a clear case to answer as far as a defendant was concerned is established, the clear public interest lies in having a jury decide positively one way or the other whether that case was established.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	In the course of his judgment, Kennedy L.J., considered the reasons for the existence of the convention, stating (paras. 18 and 19):-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	</font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;We suspect that at least part of the rationale for the convention to which Mr Clegg has referred is that the prosecution should only proceed against any given defendant if they consider that there are real prospects of obtaining a conviction from a jury. If two juries have disagreed when presented with substantially the same evidence inevitably the prosecution must carefully reconsider its position.</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	We see no reason to conclude that it should apply in the sort of circumstances with which we are concerned in this case. Furthermore, we would not elevate it into a proposition of law. We do have to have in mind, for example, the situation which might arise if one jury which disagreed was shown consequently to have been interfered with, or some highly persuasive piece of evidence were to emerge during the course of a retrial, too late perhaps to be used in that trial but capable of constituting devastating evidence on behalf of the Crown if there were to be further proceedings.&#8221;</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	On the issue of abuse of process, Kennedy L.J., mirroring the reference to </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;a breaking point&#8221;</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> mentioned in the U.S. case of </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Gunter</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">, accepted that in any given case a point might come where it would be an abuse of process for the prosecution to try again. He stated as follows (at para. 26):-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	</font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;We recognise the possibility that in any given case a time may come when it would be an abuse of process for the prosecution to try again. Whether that situation arises must depend on the facts of the case which include, first, the overall period of delay and the reasons for the delay; second, the results of the previous trial; thirdly, the seriousness of the offence or offences under consideration; and, fourthly, possibly, the extent to which the case now to be met has changed from that which was considered in previous trials.&#8221;</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Thus, in </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Charles v. The State</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> [2000] 1 W.L.R. 384 considerations of abuse of process persuaded the Privy Council to stay proceedings in the following circumstances. The three defendants were arrested in August, 1987 in connection with a fatal shooting the previous day. They were held in custody and brought before a magistrate but were not committed for trial until 1988. Their trial began in 1991 when all three were convicted of murder. Their appeals on the ground of misdirection by the trial judge were successful and a retrial took place in April, 1995. This second trial collapsed after the jury failed to agree on a verdict. A third trial began in September, 1996, but an application to stay the proceedings was brought on the ground that to try them for the third time after such a long delay was an abuse of process. That application was refused and in September, 1996 all three defendants were convicted and sentenced to death. The Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal, whereupon an appeal was brought to the Judicial Committee on the principle ground not raised before the Court of Appeal, that the trial judge should have stayed the proceedings. Lord Slynn of Hadley delivered a judgment in which, having acknowledged local difficulties in the provision of adequate court facilities in Trinidad and Tobago, stated at p.390:-</font>
<ul><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		</font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;Even so there may come a time when the delay is so great that even having regard to the public interest in convicting the guilty it becomes an abuse of process and unacceptable for a prosecution to continue. The delay is here on any view considerable and disturbing. The defendants contend that there has been no case in the Caribbean where the delay has been so great, particularly when the charge is one of murder and when the defendants have been under sentence of death for many years, with the increased agony, recognised in  Pratt v. Attorney-General for Jamaica  [1994] 2 A.C. 1, which such incarceration imposes.</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	It must be stressed that the complaint here is not just on the ground of delay but also on the ground that it was quite wrong that these defendants should have been put on trial not for the second but for the third time after so many years and when one conviction had already been quashed and when one jury had been unable to agree on a verdict. It may be contrary to due process and unacceptable as a separate ground from delay that the prosecution having failed twice should continue to try to secure a conviction. In this case however both factors fall to be considered.</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Their Lordships recognise that the trial judge has a margin of discretion in these cases and that they will not readily interfere with the exercise of this discretion. After careful consideration, however, they are satisfied that the combination of these two factors required the trial judge in this case to stay the third trial. For the prosecution to continue was wrong in principle and constituted a misuse of the criminal process.&#8221;</font></i></ul>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Commenting upon this passage in Lord Slynn&#8217;s judgment, Kennedy L.J. in </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Henworth</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> stated (at para. 25):-</font>
<ul><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	</font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;We see no reason to think that when saying what he did, Lord Slynn intended even to suggest that there should be some new principle of law such as that for which Mr Clegg now contends. If we are wrong as to that, we respectfully reject the suggestion that any such principle should be said by this Court to exist. Where a serious crime has been committed and it is shown that there is a case to answer as far as a defendant is concerned, there is a clear public interest in having a jury decide positively one way or the other, whether that case is established.&#8221;</font></i></ul>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">I find the reasoning of Kennedy L.J. in the </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Henworth</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> case to be persuasive. It eschews any simplistic approach which simply states that two trials are enough - and that in </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">no </font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">circumstances can there be a third -when careful analysis of all the surrounding circumstances may suggest that an aborted trial, including one resulting from a hung jury, may be amenable to an explanation which would strongly suggest that the public interest justifies a further trial. Kennedy L.J. gave a number of examples of particular instances where a further trial might be appropriate in the citations to which I have referred.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Nonetheless, there clearly exists in England and Wales a settled practice whereby, at least in the case of successive jury disagreements, a third trial is seen as going beyond the conventional practice. Different considerations may well arise where there have been mistrials occurring for other reasons. Whether this is expressed as a rule of practice or rule of law may ultimately be a matter of semantics.</font><br>
<br>
<b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">THE POSITION IN IRELAND</font></u></b><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	In Ireland, the principle of double jeopardy has only been seen as applying in cases where a person tried for a criminal offence has been either acquitted or convicted. In either situation, a plea of </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">autrefois acquit</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> or </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">autrefois convict</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> will operate to prevent any further steps by the prosecution. The general principles were summarised by Murray C.J. in </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Registrar of Companies v. Anderson</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> [2005] 1 I.R. 21 where he outlined the position in the following manner at pp. 26 and 27:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;It has for a long time been a principle of the common law that a person cannot be prosecuted and punished for an offence of which he has already been acquitted or convicted. This is commonly referred to as the rule against double jeopardy. It is a rule which applies to the prosecution of criminal offences. The rule, or what also might be called the notion, of double jeopardy is not normally relied upon in express terms in the sense that if a person is prosecuted for an offence arising out of the same breach of the law or the same essential ingredients for which he has previously been tried and either convicted or acquitted, his defence to the second prosecution will be based on the pleas of autrefois acquit or autrefois convict. If either plea is successful the prosecution may proceed no further. </font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	I suppose if a prosecution was initiated against a person for an offence for which he had previously been prosecuted and was awaiting trial, he or she might well invoke the rule of double jeopardy in a general sense but the fundamental basis for resisting the second prosecution would be grounded more on an abuse of process or that the court concerned with the second prosecution had no jurisdiction to deal with the matter when another court was already seized with an existing prosecution for the same offence.&#8221;</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Previously, in </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Attorney General</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">v. Kelly</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> (No.2) [1938] 1 I.R. 109, the Court of Criminal Appeal gave a clear indication that when a jury is unable to agree on a verdict there is no determination such as would enable an accused to invoke the principle of double jeopardy.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	In </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Kelly </font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">the appellant had been tried for murder, convicted and sentenced to death. He appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal and the conviction and sentence were quashed and a retrial ordered in accordance with the provisions of the Courts of Justice Act 1928 on the ground that after the trial had concluded the accused had ascertained that certain persons, whom he named, would give evidence on his behalf which, if accepted by a jury, would conclusively establish his innocence of the crime of which he had been convicted. He was retried in the Central Criminal Court but the jury were unable to agree upon a verdict and were accordingly discharged. The accused was again put upon trial, but before the trial opened he caused an application to be made that the indictment be quashed on the basis that s.5(1)(b) of the Courts of Justice Act 1928 contemplated only one trial, so that no order for a retrial could be made thereunder, even if the first trial was aborted by reason of the failure of the jury to agree upon a verdict.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The provisions of the sub-section stated:-</font>

</ul>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	In delivering the judgment of the court, Sullivan C.J. stated (at pp. 113 and 114):-</font>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	&#8220;This court is satisfied that when that sub-section speaks of a &#8216;re-trial&#8217; it contemplates a proceeding in which the guilt or innocence of the accused is determined. There is no such determination when a jury is unable to agree on a verdict. The word &#8216;re-trial&#8217; in its legal acceptation in such a context means, in the opinion of this Court, a complete and finished trial, and &#8216;when there is no verdict there has been in law no trial&#8217;: per Crampton J. in Conway and Lynch v. The Queen 7 I.L.R.149 at p.179. </font></i><i><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">It is established beyond question that when a jury in a criminal trial have failed to agree on a verdict and have been properly discharged, the accused may be put on trial again, and as often as may be necessary until the question of his guilt or innocence is determined by a verdict. </font></u></i><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">We are entitled to assume that the Legislature that enacted the Courts of Justice Act 1928, was aware of that principle and that it contemplated that sect. 5, sub-sect. 1(b) of that Act would be construed in accordance with it.&#8221;(Emphasis added)</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	As the only issue before the court was to determine the meaning of the word &#8216;</font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">re-trial&#8217;</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> within s.5 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1928 and given that the Court of Criminal Appeal determined that this word meant a finished trial and that there was no such determination when a jury is unable to agree upon a verdict, I do not share the view of the learned trial judge that what was said by the learned Chief Justice concerning repetitious trials resulting from jury disagreements was said </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">obiter</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">. On the contrary, it seems to me to be a clear statement to the effect that double jeopardy cannot arise in the context of the criminal law process in this jurisdiction until there has been either a conviction or acquittal.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	In </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Registrar of Companies v. Anderson</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> [2005] 1 I.R. 21, Geoghegan J. (at p.29) highlighted what he described as the </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;three essential protections&#8221; </font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">included in the principle of double jeopardy as being:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;1.      protection from being retried for an acquittal;</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">2.        protection from retrial after a conviction;</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">3.     protection from being punished multiple times for the same offence.&#8221;</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	He does not suggest that the principle of double jeopardy can be invoked where a conviction has been quashed for trial error or because a jury has been unable to agree upon a verdict.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	This line of reasoning is entirely consistent with that outlined in the American jurisprudence and in the reasoning offered by Justice Holmes in </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Kepner v. United States</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> 195 U.S. 100 (1904) when he suggested (at p.134) that there is only &#8216;</font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">one continuing jeopardy&#8217;</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> until a case is finally disposed of; that is to say that jeopardy may be seen as continuing until conviction or acquittal.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Certainly no Irish legislation contains any provision providing a bar to further trials where a conviction has been quashed for trial error, or where there has been jury disagreement. Specifically, the Criminal Procedure Act 1993, which repealed and replaced section 5 of the Courts of Justice Act 1928, contains no such provision. Section 4 of the Act of 1993 permits the Court of Criminal Appeal to quash a conviction and order an applicant to be retried and that power is not subject to any words of restriction. Section 4 of the Act refers to the position on retrial, stating:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	</font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;Where a person is ordered under this Act to be re-tried for an offence he may, notwithstanding any rule of law, be again indicted and tried and, if found guilty, sentenced for that offence.&#8221;</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">                       Notwithstanding, however, the absence of any statutory restriction, I believe, I hope correctly, that a practice similar to that which operates in England and Wales has traditionally existed in this jurisdiction even if it is not the subject matter of any judicial pronouncement. That practice or convention is to the effect that, if there have been two jury disagreements, a citizen should not be put on trial a third time. Counsel for the Director of Public Prosecutions says there is no such practice and we have been referred to no case law or legal writing in this jurisdiction which supports the existence of such a convention or practice. I am, however, satisfied the issue can be satisfactorily resolved without reliance on any such rule or practice.</font><br>
<br>
<b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">DECISION</font></u></b><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	From the foregoing brief review of the legal position in a number of common law jurisdictions, including our own, I am satisfied that the applicant in the present case can not invoke the principle of double jeopardy as the basis for seeking to prohibit any further trial. He has never been convicted or acquitted of either of the two offences in respect of which a retrial is proposed. There has been no jury determination in respect of either charge. The applicant is in continuing jeopardy in relation to those offences.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	However, as is apparent from both the authorities in the United States and in Britain, there must come a time in the criminal process where repeated trials of a citizen may come to be seen as oppressive and as an abuse of discretion on the part of the Director of Public Prosecutions. It may become an unfair procedure in itself to re-try. Put another way, a </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;breaking point&#8221; </font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">may be reached where no further trial should be permitted if the fairness and due process requirements of Article 38.1 of the Constitution and Article 6 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms are to be properly observed.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	I do not think that there should be an over-simplified &#8220;one size fits all&#8221; approach to the question of how many criminal trials for the same offence should be permitted. An oversimplified or stark black and white approach to the issue would, in my view, be a mistake. As Kennedy L.J. pointed out in </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Henworth</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">, jury disagreement may occur in unusual circumstances and for unusual reasons which might suggest that a further trial should take place. Nevertheless I think that in the ordinary course two trials which end in jury disagreement should be seen as an adequate discharge of the public&#8217;s interest in the prosecution of crime unless there are unusual factual circumstances which suggest otherwise. A factual analysis arising in an application to prevent a third trial would have regard to matters such as the following:-</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">1.	The seriousness of the offence or offences under consideration.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">2.	The extent, if any, to which the applicant may himself have contributed to any mishap which led to the requirement for a further trial. By way of example, the first trial of the applicant (in relation to the complainant TL) collapsed because of defence error. It would be in my view inappropriate to accede to a defendant&#8217;s request for relief where the applicant himself was the cause of the earlier trial mishap.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">3.	Any period of delay which is plainly excessive and beyond the norm for cases of the particular type and the reasons for such delay. A court will necessarily take into account in this context the considerable delay likely to arise in mounting any re-trial. It is now unusual to have a re-trial immediately after an aborted trial, such as occurred in years past, notably in </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The State v McMullen </font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">[1925] 2 I.R. 9, where the re-trial took place two days after the first trial.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">4.	The extent to which the case now to be met has altered from that which was considered in previous trials.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Counsel for the Director has argued that the Court should only intervene to review a decision of the Director to prosecute when there is evidence of </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">mala fides</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> or of an improper motive or improper policy.  I am satisfied that O&#8217;Neill J. was entirely correct in holding that the matter under consideration in the instant case has little or nothing to do with the Director&#8217;s decision to </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">initiate</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> a prosecution, as was the case in </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The State (McCormack) v. Curran</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> [1987] IRLM. 225 and </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Eviston v. Director of Public Prosecutions </font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">[2002] 3 I.R. 260.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The case of </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Eviston v. Director of Public Prosecutions</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> does, however, highlight that a court may invoke the concept of fair procedures to halt a prosecution in particular circumstances. In </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Eviston</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">, the Court intervened to prohibit a prosecution in circumstances where the Director had decided - with ample grounds for doing so - not to prosecute Mrs. Eviston in relation to a driving offence. He later changed his mind in circumstances where the family of the deceased victim of the road accident in which Mrs. Eviston had been involved made representations by letter to the then Minister for Justice. The Director reversed his original decision without having any new or additional evidence and having already notified Mrs Eviston of his intention not to prosecute. Both the High Court and this Court had little difficulty in acknowledging the basic unfairness of allowing a prosecution to be brought in such circumstances. As stated by Keane C.J. at p.299:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">        &#8220;Viewing the matter objectively, and leaving aside every element of sympathy for the applicant, I am forced to the conclusion that in circumstances where the respondent candidly acknowledges that there was no new evidence before him when the decision was reviewed, the applicant was not afforded the fair procedures to which, in all the circumstances, she was entitled.&#8221;</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">       In </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Eviston</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> the Court intervened to prevent an unfair procedure and that intervention stopped the further prosecution of Ms. Eviston. While this Court did not characterise its intervention as one to prevent an abuse of process, it is difficult to see what complaint there could have been if the judgment had been based on abuse of process grounds.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">        Looking at the facts of the present case, I would observe at the outset that the trial process has been in train since 2002. While O&#8217;Neill J referred to the prospect of five trials of the applicant, there have been two trials only on the charges under consideration. The trial in respect of the first complainant was severed from the other complainant&#8217;s case at the request of the applicant, and the jury was discharged in the first of the trials in relation to the first complainant because of an error on the part of the defence. I do not see that the applicant can build a case on either of these grounds which in any event relate to different charges involving a different complainant.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">           On the scale of gravity of sexual offences, however, the surviving charges in this case can only be described as being at the less serious end of the spectrum. In so saying I do not ignore the huge distress described by the complainant. However the offences occurred many years ago, mainly between 1993 and 1994 and there has thus been considerable delay in bringing this matter to a conclusion. This Court has frequently commented upon the deleterious effects of delay in the context of criminal prosecutions.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">          The medical reports make it abundantly clear that the applicant and his family have suffered enormously as a result of the accusations which have been extremely damaging in the small rural community in which the parties reside. The applicant was asked to leave his position as trainer for the local GAA club. His wife has been alienated from her own family and driven to taking anti-depressants. His eldest daughter was verbally abused at school by some girls who asked her questions such as </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;When did your father last rape somebody?&#8221; </font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">His other children have also become withdrawn and stressed. The applicant&#8217;s mother died during the court hearings and the applicant believes her death was hastened by the stress of the ongoing proceedings. The applicant himself missed work at times and found it difficult to socialise or go out with his wife. His psychiatrist says that he is under </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;very major stress&#8221;.</font></i><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">          There is no suggestion that the applicant himself bears any responsibility for the prolongation of the criminal proceedings, albeit that he can not invoke the first aborted trial in aid of his application. However, any error which may have occurred at that particular juncture was not his personal fault.        </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">            On a more general basis and because it is one of the factors to which I have adverted, I see no basis for holding that in the context of any re-trial (if one were to be permitted) the State would be precluded from serving a Notice of Additional Evidence if some further information or evidence had come to light between a first and subsequent trial: the Criminal Procedure Act 1967 so permits. I feel it necessary to mention this point as the trial judge expressed concerns that repeated trials increased the risk of an innocent man being convicted through the </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8216;adjustment&#8217;</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> of evidence where it was seen to have been inadequate in previous trials. I am not quite sure what he meant by this comment which, on one view, implies that evidence might be fabricated or doctored if a re-trial were to be permitted. To the extent that the trial judge was expressing such a view or deriving a basis for such a view from the &#8216;evidentiary insufficiency&#8217; cases in the U.S. I do not believe this to be an appropriate inference from those cases. Furthermore, there is no suggestion in this case that the evidence ever changed from one trial to the other.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">        Reviewing the case as a whole, however, I see no circumstances which suggest that there are unusual or exceptional circumstances which would justify treating this case as one where a third trial should be permitted following the two jury disagreements to date.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">        I would therefore dismiss the appeal and affirm the order of the learned High Court judge on the grounds I have identified, namely, abuse of discretion and fair procedures.</font><br>
