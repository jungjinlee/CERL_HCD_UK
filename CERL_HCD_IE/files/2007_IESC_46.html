<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">JUDGMENT of Mr. Justice Hardiman delivered the 25th day of October, 2007.</font></b>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">1.	This is an appeal, brought pursuant to s.29 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, from the judgment and order of the Court of Criminal Appeal delivered the 27th day of May, 2004.  By that judgment and order the Court of Criminal Appeal (Denham J., O Caoimh J., and Butler J.), dismissed the respective appellants&#8217; applications for leave to appeal.  This leave has been sought to appeal their convictions, after a trial by judge and jury, of the offence of endangerment.  The trial took place between the 17th June, 2002, and the 26th June, 2002, inclusive. Each appellant had been charged with the offence of manslaughter of one David Langan and also with the offence of endangerment, contrary to s.13 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997.  Ronan McGrath was also charged with a third offence, now irrelevant, which was withdrawn from the jury by the judge in the course of the trial. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2.	The relevant charges against these appellants were as follows:</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	Count 1.</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">Statement of Offence.</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">	Manslaughter contrary to Common Law.</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Particulars of offence.</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">	Ronan McGrath and Fergal Cagney on the 30th August, 2000, at Grove Road in the County of the City of Dublin did unlawfully kill one David Langan. </font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	Count 2.</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">Statement of offence.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	Reckless endangerment contrary to s.13 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Particulars of offence.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	Ronan McGrath and Fergal Cagney on or about the 25th August, 2000, at Grove Road in the County of the City of Dublin did intentionally or recklessly engage in conduct which created a substantive risk of death or serious harm to another.</font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">3.	Each accused was acquitted on Count No. 1, manslaughter, but convicted of Count No. 2, endangerment.  It is common case that each offence related to David Langan i.e. in terms of the statute, that David Langan is the &#8220;other&#8221; referred to in the endangerment charge. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">4.	The jury at the trial reached its verdicts after a deliberation exceeding seven hours in length.  The conviction was, in each case, by a majority of ten jurors to two. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">5.	The deceased, David Langan, was nineteen years old at the time of the events leading to his death.  Ronan McGrath was also nineteen and Fergal Cagney was then seventeen years old.  None of the three had any previous convictions or had come to the attention of the gardaí.  The two appellants have not come to the unfavourable attention of the gardaí since the events of August, 2000 either.  The evidence at the trial was that they were most unlikely to re-offend, and this was accepted by the learned trial judge.  Each received a sentence of fifteen months imprisonment. Having regard to the issues raised on appeal, each was admitted to bail shortly after the conviction and has remained on bail since.  The two appellants are cousins.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The facts.</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">6.	The factual background to the death of Mr. Langan can be shortly stated.  The deceased and the two accused attended a night club and bar called the Palace, on Camden Street, Dublin.  When they left, the deceased, for reasons unknown, laid hands on Mr. McGrath and threw him into the shutters which had been lowered at the entrance to the premises.  After this, the deceased and the two appellants, together with other acquaintances, walked a distance of about 600 yards southwards to Portobello Bridge.  The apparent reason for this was that the junction of Rathmines Road and Grove Road, which runs west along the southern bank of the Grand Canal, was thought to be a good place for getting taxis, which all present intended to do.  Mr. McGrath, however, resented what Mr. Langan had done to him outside the Palace and on several occasions shouted at him inquiring why he had treated him in that way.  Mr. McGrath was regarded by some at least of those present as aggressive in view of what happened to him.  Some of his friends walked with him, ready to restrain him if necessary.  Equally, it was common case that Mr. Cagney had been calm and good humoured on the journey from the Palace to Portobello Bridge and that his endeavours were directed at &#8220;keeping the peace&#8221;, a phrase used by several of the witnesses, clearly referring to keeping the peace between Mr. McGrath and Mr. Langan.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7.	The physical location at Portobello Bridge was minutely described in the course of the trial.  The bridge spans the Grand Canal, between South Richmond Street on the North side and the Lower Rathmines Road on the South side.  Immediately to the west of the bridge are the old 18th century lock workings consisting of a lock chamber and two sets of lock gates.  On the Rathmines side these are separated from the roadway and associated pavement by a low wall, the top of the lock workings being a foot or two below street level.  One can cross the canal either by the main Portobello Bridge or by a plank bridge attached to the lock gates, as at least one of the witnesses did.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">8.	It appears that, when the party of young men who had been in the Palace nightclub came to the Grove Road area to look for taxis, Messrs. Langan and McGrath were in closer proximity to each other than they had been on the walk up to Portobello Bridge.  There was a confrontation between them.  This was vocal and noisy enough to awaken a man who was sleeping in his apartment in an adjacent block of flats.  Mr. McGrath was restrained by one of the witnesses, Mr. Thomas Rooney. Mr. Cagney interposed himself between Mr. McGrath and Mr. Langan.  The two last mentioned &#8220;started squaring up before each other&#8230; they got in each others face&#8221;, to use phrases from Mr. Rooney&#8217;s evidence. Rooney then grabbed Mr. McGrath by his jacket &#8220;&#8230; and then [McGrath] told Fergal (Mr. Cagney) to hit David&#8221;.  He continued &#8220;And then when Ronan asked Fergal to hit him he went and hit him&#8230; Ronan said &#8216;Hit him Fergal&#8217;.&#8221;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">9.	Mr. Rooney said Mr. Cagney hit the deceased with the heel of his hand around the ear or just above the ear, meaning the left ear. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">10.	Mr. Cagney, on the other hand, made statements to the gardaí and answered questions posed by them in which he said he had indeed struck Mr. Langan, but did so in self defence when Mr. Langan came towards him with his hands raised.  Mr. Cagney said he did not hear Mr. McGrath saying &#8220;Hit him&#8221;.  It was common case that, shortly after being struck, Mr. Langan had fallen on the road and on being attended to by the group present appeared to be unconscious.  He did not subsequently recover consciousness and died on the 30th August in hospital.  There was however some dispute as to whether he fell close to where he was hit, as the prosecution suggested or about eleven metres away, as the appellants contended.  The blow or blows struck by Mr. Cagney was described as not being a boxers&#8217; blow.  This description is not precise or helpful, but does not suggest a planned or skilfully struck blow.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The medical evidence.</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">11.	The only relevant charges are the two set out above.  Specifically, there was no charge of assault.  In course of argument on this appeal counsel for the Director could not offer any specific explanation as to why the endangerment charge was brought, and no assault charges were brought, but he indicated that the weakness of the manslaughter case, as perceived by the prosecution, related to causation i.e. to the difficulty of proving that the deceased&#8217;s death had been caused by the blow struck by Mr. Cagney.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">12.	The medical evidence at the trial was principally that of Professor John Harbison, then the State Pathologist and of Mr. Allcutt, Consultant Neurosurgeon.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">13.	Dr. Harbison had occupied the position of State Pathologist in a most distinguished manner since 1974 and had unrivalled experience in post mortem examination in cases of suspicious death.  His thoroughness and impartiality were well known to all who had dealings with him.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">14.	The deceased had been taken to St. James&#8217;s Hospital in the first instance, where he was assessed, and subsequently transferred to Beaumont Hospital which has a specialist neurosurgical unit.  A doctor from St. James&#8217;s, Dr. Phelan, said that, on admission, the deceased had a wound to his scalp at the right side towards the back, not quite in the middle of the back of the head, a little to the right of that. When he went for a brain scan it showed that he had bruising to his brain at that site and also on the opposite side at the front.  This latter injury was referred to as the contrecoup injury i.e. an injury in the left front of the brain caused by a trauma to the right rear of the head, and was fully discussed in evidence by Dr. Harbison.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">15.	The deceased was intubated to help him breathe and transferred to Beaumont Hospital.  He was received there by Mr. Allcutt, Consultant Neurosurgeon. He said:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;His injuries appear to be confined to his head.  We noted that he had a laceration and some associated bruising over the back of his head which had already been sutured in St. James&#8217;s Hospital&#8221;. </font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">16.	He confirmed the position of the wound as described by Dr. Phelan.  Scans confirmed the existence of contusions in the left frontal region as also mentioned by Dr. Phelan.  X-rays revealed swelling in the brain which produced raised inter-cranial pressure which in the end became uncontrollable.  By the 30th August, 2000, the deceased had suffered brain stem death.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">17.	Dr. Harbison performed a post mortem some months after these events, on the 18th December, 2000, after the deceased&#8217;s body had been exhumed.  He described the deceased as &#8220;a large young man&#8221; and he found: </font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;a fracture of the right side of the back of his skull with bruising of the overlying muscles   this fracture and bruising were </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">consistent with a fall</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">, as a result of which the right side of the back of his head struck an immovable object, which I presume was the ground. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I could not give an exact cause of death from this examination because the brain had already been cross-sectioned by Professor Farrell who is an expert neuropathologist.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> this appears to have been a fall, his head hit the ground with considerable force sufficient to cause a fracture at the base of his skull.&#8221; (Emphasis added)</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">18.	Prosecuting counsel elicited that Dr. Harbison was aware that it had been alleged that the deceased had been struck in the face on the left hand side prior to his fall.  The doctor said:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;So I had been informed. I carried out an extensive dissection of the skin of the head, including the entire face, and found no evidence of any deep facial bruising, although the overlying skin of the left cheek was considerably darkened.  In the absence of bruising, or bleeding, beneath this dark area, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">I could not corroborate</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> an allegation of a blow to that site. The deep bruising of the right side of the back of the head was the only injury to the head. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It must be borne in mind however that if the deceased had been caught off balance, or was inebriated - that is drunk - a push could have toppled him over and thus he could have incurred his fractured skull.&#8221; (Emphasis added)</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">19.	Dr. Harbison then gave the blood alcohol reading of the deceased as taken about the time he was brought to St. James&#8217;s Hospital at 192mg per 100ml and conceded in cross-examination that it might have been higher at the time of the episodes, perhaps at the level of 210mg per 100ml.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">20.	Dr. Harbison then discussed the findings of the post mortem conducted immediately or very shortly after death by Dr. Farrell, Neuropathologist.  It was he who used the term contrecoup to describe the injury to the front of the brain. Dr. Harbison said that it was &#8220;a French word meaning &#8216;opposite blow&#8217; with coup referring to the &#8216;actual blow&#8217; or &#8216;forcible contact&#8217;, here involving the right inferior cerebellar hemisphere (the injury to the back of the head).&#8221;  The cause of death identified at the first post mortem was the compression of his brain stem due to the accumulation of blood and swelling in his brain.  He said &#8220;The contact with the ground which caused the fracture was at the right back of the head, and therefore the brain would suffer its maximum injury front left.&#8221;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">21.	It appears that it was the omission, in the first post mortem results, to identify evidence of a blow, or to posit a blow as a necessary part of the sequence to events leading to death, which perturbed the prosecution.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The charges.</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">22.	The medical evidence summarised above was of course within the knowledge of the prosecution when they framed the charges against the two appellants.  As mentioned above, those in charge of the prosecution were concerned about weakness in the evidence linking the blow(s) struck by Mr. Cagney to the brain stem damage suffered by the deceased.  The only externally visible injury on the deceased was the injury to the back of his head which two doctors said was consistent with a fall.  The State Pathologist said that the level of intoxication of the deceased would be likely to cause &#8220;in-coordination&#8221; which he defined as a propensity to fall.  He said that an intoxicated person might also fall easily in response to a push, or being mildly unbalanced, by tripping, or otherwise.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">23.	In this state of the evidence, it is easy to see why a prosecutor would wish to bring another charge in case the manslaughter charge could not be sustained either because of the difficulty in showing causation or for any other reason.  The most obvious alternative reason why it might fail would be if Mr. Cagney&#8217;s allegation of an attack by Mr. Langan were accepted by the jury, or were found to create reasonable scope for self defence, or a reasonable doubt on that issue. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">24.	The most obvious alternative charge to that of manslaughter was some form of assault charge, either in the basic form of common assault or its statutory equivalent (s.2 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act) or in one of its aggravated forms.  Section 2 assault would expose a person of conviction to a penalty of up to six months imprisonment: s.3 assault, assault occasioning harm, would expose him to a penalty of up to five years imprisonment and an unlimited fine.  Assault occasioning serious harm exposes a person on conviction to imprisonment for life and an unlimited fine.  In the circumstances of the present case, it is obvious that any difficulties that might be thought to attach to proving that the appellant Mr. Cagney&#8217;s actions caused the death of the deceased would also attach to proving that they caused serious harm to him.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">25.	In any event, none of these options were taken by the prosecution who instead opted to charge both accused with the offence of endangerment.  This is a statutory offence created by s.13 of the Act of 1997 which provides as follows:</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	&#8220;13(1)	A person shall be guilty of an offence who intentionally or recklessly engages in conduct which creates a substantial risk of death or serious harm to another.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	(2)	A person guilty of an offence under this Section shall be liable - </font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">(a)	On summary conviction to a fine not exceeding &#8364;1,500 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding twelve months or both or</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(b)	On conviction on indictment to a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years or to both.&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">26.	It will be seen that a major feature of this offence is that it resides in the creation of the risk of death or serious harm, and not the accomplished reality of either.  Secondly, the penalty on indictment exceeds that available for all but the most serious form of assault.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">27.	The question certified by the Court of Criminal Appeal in this case, pursuant to s.29 of the Act of 1924, is as follows:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;Is the offence of endangerment contrary to s.13 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997 capable of being construed so as to cover circumstances such as in the instant case?&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">28.	This is an important question.  In the first place, this appears to be the first case where the offence created by s.13 has been fully considered by the appellate courts.  It will be seen that the offence itself is general in scope and not specific, so that it may be applied after the event to events which are not obviously criminal in themselves and whose legality or otherwise cannot be accurately assessed in advance.  For example, would the terms of the statute extend to an omission to assist an individual in circumstances which, perhaps, would involve some risk to an intervener?  Does it extend to actions done with the alleged victims consent, as in the context of extreme sports?  These are important questions and the fact that the answers to them are not immediately apparent indicates just how radically the law has (or, at least, may have been) altered by s.13.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The offence of endangerment.</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">29.	It is beyond doubt, and was accepted by the learned trial judge (transcript of the hearing of the 26th July, 2002, p.28) that the death of the unfortunate deceased man, Mr. Langan, was unintentional. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">30.	In this case, the two counts were left to the jury in the following way. Prosecuting counsel (transcript F, p.18) told them that:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220; if you decide not to convict on manslaughter, you must then go on to consider reckless endangerment, because they both relate to the same incident, they are alternatives for the purpose of your decision.&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">31.	It should however be noted that in</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Charleton et al Criminal Law </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">(Butterworths Ireland, 1999), the comment is made at p.735, during a discussion of the offence of endangerment:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;If death does occur, murder or manslaughter should be charged depending on what may be proven.&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">32.	In the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in this case, delivered by Denham J., considerable attention was paid to the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission which led to the enactment of the offence constituted by s.13 of the 1997 Act. Indeed it was said that:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;This offence came to the Statute Book subsequent to the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission: Report on Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person (LRC 45 - 1994), hereinafter referred to as the Law Reform Commission Report.  The Act of 1997 repealed a large portion of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 and is a reform of the law </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Law Reform Commission envisaged that this would not be an offence to replace existing offences. Rather it would be a supplement, a residual generic offence.&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">33.	In my view, this observation of the Court of Criminal Appeal is evidently correct.  The Law Reform Commission, in the sections of its report quoted in the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, observed that the creation of a general offence of this kind is not an easy matter or one to be undertaken lightly: there is a danger of &#8220;unduly extending the scope of the criminal law.&#8221;  But the offence has been enacted and the legislature&#8217;s decision in that regard must be respected.  There is however a possibility that the Section might be interpreted over-broadly so as to cover circumstances which the legislature had not considered, and to criminalise certain things which are not and were not intended to be the subject of prohibition.  I have given an example earlier in this judgment, relating to a possibly criminal omission to act in particular circumstances.  Equally, the question may arise of whether the consent of the person allegedly endangered to run a risk, if established, is of any relevance: this could clearly be a crucial matter if a person is killed while engaging voluntarily in a dangerous sport.  This question is not addressed in the statute.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">34.	From a legal and constitutional point of view, it is a fundamental value that a citizen should know, or at least be able to find out, with some considerable measure of certainty, what precisely is prohibited and what is lawful. Thus, in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Attorney General v. Cunningham</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1932] IR 28 O&#8217;Byrne J. said at the Court of Criminal Appeal:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;The offence as charged in the indictment is one of maliciously firing into a dwellinghouse and it seems to us that the proper question for our determination is whether that is, at Common Law, an indictable offence. In considering that question the Court must have regard to the</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> fundamental doctrine recognised in these courts that the criminal law must be certain and specific</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">, and that no person is to be punished unless and until he has been convicted of an offence recognised by law as a crime and punishable as such&#8221;. (Emphasis added)</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">35.	Equally, in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">King v. Attorney General</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1981] IR 223, Kenny J. said:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;It is a fundamental feature of our system of government by law (and not by decree or diktat) that citizens may be convicted only of offences which have been specified with precision by the judges who made the common law, or offences which, created by statute, are expressed </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">without ambiguity</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8230; in my opinion both governing phrases (in s.4 of the Vagrancy Act, 1824) &#8216;a suspected person&#8217; and &#8216;reputed thief&#8217; are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">so uncertain that they cannot form the foundation for a criminal offence</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">.&#8221; (Emphasis added)</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">36.	In the present case, there was no root and branch attack on the Section by suggesting that it was inconsistent with the Constitution, and it is of course entitled to the benefit of a presumption of constitutionality. Nevertheless the obvious potential for conflict with the fundamental value that crimes must be defined with precision and without ambiguity so that the criminal law is &#8220;certain and specific&#8221; require that this notably open ended Section be carefully, and indeed strictly, construed in accordance with fundamental principles of law and of construction. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">37.	Considerations of the same sort, in my view, make it undesirable that so vague and open ended a Section should be used in circumstances such as those of the present case where the actions of the defendants as alleged by the prosecution would clearly constitute an established and recognised criminal offence, viz. assault in one or other of its variants. In those circumstances, in my view, it is desirable that the obvious offence should be charged. This is for the same reason as led Mr. Justice Charleton and his co-authors of the work cited above to suggest that where death does occur manslaughter or murder should be charged, depending on what can be proven, rather than endangerment. I wish specifically to endorse that sentiment and to express concern about the bringing of a charge of endangerment in all its uncertainty where a more specific charge is available. With regard to the mental element of the offence, I agree with what is said in the judgment about to be delivered by Mr. Justice Geoghegan.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">38.	The Law Reform Commission Report, which features so heavily in the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, contains a good deal of interesting historical material.  Amongst the fruits of their researches is the fact that, prior to the beginning of the Victorian era, a Commission in the former United Kingdom recommended the creation of a general offence such as that created here by s.13.  This is a factor of great historical interest: it must however be balanced against the fact that this advice was not taken and that the Victorian legislatures instead preferred to rely on a great number of highly specific offences such as the provision of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, which prohibits (on pain of life imprisonment) the throwing of stones or other implements at moving trains.  Indeed, to this day there is in the U.K. no such general offence as that provided in this jurisdiction by s.13.  Any conclusion about why people long since dead acted as they did is of necessity speculative but, having regard to the terms of the report of the Law Reform Commission itself, it seems quite likely that the Victorian legislators were careful not &#8220;unduly to extend the scope of a criminal law&#8221; and not to create a criminal offence whose parameters were uncertain so that they could not be predicted in advance and might lead to the criminalisation of an activity which the legislature had not decided to criminalise and might have decided not to criminalise.  It is one of the glories of the Common Law tradition of civil liberties that in general it is safe to proceed on the basis that what is not prohibited is allowed (</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">nullum crimen sine lege</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">): this situation can only be preserved by taking care that the criminal law is &#8220;certain and specific&#8221;, in the words of O&#8217;Byrne J., cited above.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">39.	Since the Law Reform Commission has undertaken such conspicuous historical research it may be appropriate to point out that, as long ago as 1815, the House of Commons repealed a Thames Police Act passed the previous year because, unknown to the legislators, by a &#8220;pious fraud&#8221; a clause which banned swimming in the river had been slipped in.  The banning of swimming in public places was then a major preoccupation of the Evangelical lobby, led in Parliament by William Wilberforce M.P. Another M.P. of that remote date said that &#8220; this is one of those melancholy evils which result from an itch for legislating which prevails in the subordinate offices of the State&#8221;.  A similar attitude may have informed the omission to act on the Report to which the Law Reform Commission refers (see </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Wilson Decency and disorder - the age of Cant - 1789 - 1837</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, Faber and Faber 2007).</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">40.	It is inconceivable, in my view, that a s.13 charge would have been preferred in this case were it not for the fatality.  Four doctors gave statements or reports to the prosecution, at least two of whom had a special professional interest in head injuries.  None, however, were asked to opine on whether the blow or blows said to have been struck by Mr. Cagney were such as to create a &#8220;substantial&#8221; risk of death or serious harm to a healthy nineteen year old in Mr. Langan&#8217;s position, or whether there were grounds to advert to such a risk on the facts proved.  Alternatively, such a drastic result might have been improbable, unlikely, odd or even freakish.  The omission to explore this topic may be due to a failure adequately to consider the mental element of the offence created by s.13 or of the state of recklessness in general, or to notice that an element of advertence is required in either case. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">41.	Instead of offering medical or other evidence on this topic, the prosecution appears to me to have proceeded on the basis that the fatality itself was the indicator of the existence of a substantial risk. No other evidence of the existence of such risk was offered.  This is both illogical and ignores the obvious fact that huge risks are often taken without any actual consequence at all while tiny risks, unpredictably and improbably, may result in catastrophe. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">42.	In this case, the s.13 offence was left to the jury as an &#8220;alternative&#8221; to manslaughter without any explanation from the prosecution or the learned trial judge of the sense in which the second charge was alternative to the first. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">43.	I am of the opinion that s.13 is often presented as an alternative to a jury who may not fully understand the seriousness of the offence created by that Section, in the hope that the jury may think it is a trivial or technical offence only. In my view, if the State prefers a charge as an &#8220;alternative&#8221; to another, the sense in which it is an alternative and the circumstances in which the alternative may become relevant, should be explained.  This is always done in dealing with the classic alternative charges of stealing and receiving (now handling stolen property). In this case, no explanation of any kind was given other than the statement quoted elsewhere in this judgment.  This mode of proceeding, in my opinion, was not fair to the defendants or to the jury. On the hearing of this appeal, where naturally there was no jury, the prosecution frankly referred to their possible difficulties in proving causation.  They may have felt that to do this in the presence of the jury would have gravely undermined their chances of a conviction on the manslaughter charge.  This approach made the s.13 charge, not an alternative in any real sense, but a fall back. If there was genuine doubt as to causation, there should not have been a conviction of manslaughter in any event and in fact the appellants were acquitted on that charge. But the case was left to the jury on the basis that the prosecution told them that the endangerment charge was alternative to manslaughter without further explanation.  The prosecution did not discuss the elements of the offence of endangerment but left that to the trial judge; they offered no assistance when he charged the jury without referring to the need for advertence. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">44.	There is further evidence of confusion on the part of the prosecution as to what, precisely, these defendants were guilty of (if anything) and why.  In the State&#8217;s written submissions to the Court of Criminal Appeal it was contended that:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;There was evidence from which the jury was entitled to infer that Fergal Cagney by allowing himself to become the instrument of his cousin&#8217;s rage against David Langan, shared his intention to do the deceased serious harm.&#8221; </font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">45.	By reason of s.4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1964, that </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">mens rea</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, if established, would have made the defendants guilty of murder, assuming causation were proved between the alleged assault and the death.  This was a very extraordinary submission to make in the case of two defendants each of whom had already, prior to the submissions being filed, been acquitted of manslaughter in respect of the same incident.  They had never been charged with murder.  Neither in the Court of Criminal Appeal, nor in this court, was any attempt made to stand over this submission, which raises the question of why it was made in the first place.  As already noted, the learned trial judge accepted that the death of the deceased was unintentional.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">46.	The new statutory offence created by s.13 took its rise from the Law Reform Commission Report quoted aptly and extensively in the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal.  As that report makes clear, it was designed to fill a gap and not merely to provide an alternative.  If an alternative to a charge of manslaughter is needed, because of difficulty in proving causation or otherwise, it already exists in the form of assault either in its basic form or in some aggravated form.  In this respect there is no &#8220;gap&#8221; to be filled in a case like the present. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">47.	The Law Reform Commission was, as I have already pointed out, conscious that an offence of this sort might constitute an undue expansion of criminal liability.  It considered however that:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;The undue expansion of liability may be avoided, in the view of the Commission, by limiting the offence:</font>
<ul><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(a)	To acts of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">advertent</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> risk taking i.e. recklessness; and </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(b)	To such acts as create a substantial risk of death or a serious harm to another person. Recklessly placing another in danger of injury less than &#8216;serious harm&#8217; should not be covered and the circumstances must be sufficiently serious to create a &#8216;substantial risk&#8217; of such harm, this being a question of fact for determination on the evidence (at para. 9.243).&#8221; (Emphasis added)</font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">48.	This is a very significant quotation, not least because it defines recklessness as advertent risk taking.  This aspect of the requirements of the offence were extensively discussed by defence counsel, in particular Mr. Murphy S.C. for Mr. Cagney, in applying for a direction at the end of the prosecution case but does not seem to feature at all in the charge to the jury.  Moreover, a passage of the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal at p.21 is open to the interpretation - it is not possible to say more - that advertence is required only as to the external actions said to constitute the conduct of the defendant or the actus reus of the offence.  The relevant passage is as follows:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;Thus the constituent parts of the offence as applicable may be construed as the applicant intentionally or recklessly, engaging in conduct, which created a substantial risk of death or serious injury to David Langan.  Considering this aspect of the matter the Court is satisfied also that it was within the trial judge&#8217;s jurisdiction to leave this matter to the jury&#8221;.</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">49.	This formulation, in my view, fails to make it clear that recklessness involves not merely the taking of a risk but the advertent taking of the risk.  The Courts (as the Court of Criminal Appeal pointed out in this case), are not of course bound by the views of the Law Reform Commission on this or any other question. However, it appears to me that the well established principles of law in relation to recklessness amply support the Commission&#8217;s view that this offence, when committed recklessly as opposed to intentionally, requires advertence.  It is to this point that I now turn.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">50.	On the hearing of this appeal it was submitted on behalf of Mr. Cagney, referring to the portion of the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal quoted above:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;On this analysis the requirement for </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">mens rea</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> extends only to the physical act or omission of the accused, and the question of substantial risk of death or serious harm is to be assessed objectively without regard to the state of mind of the accused the insertion of commas around the phrase &#8216;engages in conduct&#8217; suggests that the requirement for intention or recklessness relates only to the conduct and not to the substantial risk of death or serious harm created thereby.  Such an analysis is inconsistent with the requirement for a guilty mind.  Indeed, it is submitted, that it may be said of the offence of endangerment that the substantial risk of death or serious harm is the very gist of the offence and therefore the ordinary requirement for proof of a guilty mind with respect to that element applies.&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">51.	I believe that this submission is well founded. I would prefer rephrase the summary of the Section offered by the Court of Criminal Appeal (quoted above) as follows:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;Thus the constituent parts of the offence as applicable may be construed as the appellant intentionally or recklessly engaging in conduct which creates a substantial risk of death or serious injury, to which he has adverted, to another.&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">52.	I believe that this approach is consistent with the authorative statement of the requirements of recklessness in this jurisdiction.  The locus classicus on this topic is the decision of this Court in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">DPP v. Murray</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1977] 360.  The law on recklessness in Ireland is, by virtue of this decision, in decided contrast with that applied in the United Kingdom in such cases as </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Elliott v. C. (A Minor)</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1983] 2 AER 1005.  There, a mentally retarded fourteen year old girl was found guilty of a serious offence because the Court applied an objective test for recklessness and held that she had taken a risk, the possible consequences of which was obvious to the ordinary individual, even if not to her.  As a result of the judgment in Murray, an accused in Ireland must have foreseen the risk that his conduct would bring about the relevant result, but have elected to proceed with his conduct nonetheless.  The superiority of this approach is perhaps indicated by the fact that, in the English case cited, Goff LJ said that he would prefer to reach the opposite result, but felt precluded from doing so.  (See .1012h of the report).</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">53.	Murray was the well known case in which two defendants were charged with the (capital) murder of a garda.  The issue was, so far as relevant here, whether the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">mens rea</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> must extend not only to an intention to cause death or serious injury but the knowledge of, or at least recklessness about, the victim&#8217;s status as a member of An Garda Síochána.  In the Murray case, this distinction literally was the distinction between life and death: the defendants would have been liable to a death sentence if the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">mens rea</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> were restricted in the manner for which the prosecution contended. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">54.	Walsh J. in the Supreme Court said:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;It is well established that, unless a statute either clearly or by necessary implication rules out </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">mens rea</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as a constituent part of a crime, a court cannot find a person guilty of an offence against the criminal law unless he has a guilty mind.  It has been pointed out earlier in this judgment that s.4 of the Act of 1964 makes murder an offence of specific intent.  A person cannot be guilty of a capital murder of a Civic Guard in the course of his duty unless that person intends to murder a Civic Guard in the course of his duty or intends to do serious injury to a Civic Guard in the course of his duty, and that injury causes the death of the guard.  To intend to murder, or to cause serious injury to, a Civic Guard in the course of his duty is to have in mind a fixed purpose to reach that desired object.  Therefore, the state of mind of the accused person must have been not only that he foresaw but also willed the possible consequences of his conduct.  There cannot be intention unless there is also foresight, and it is this subjective element of foresight that constitutes the necessary </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">mens rea</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">.&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">55.	Henchy J. said:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;Once the prosecution proved (as they clearly did) that the appellant Marie Murray murdered Michael Reynolds, it was necessary for a conviction on the capital offence to prove the further mens rea of intention (or recklessness, its alternative in the law of mens rea in this context) as would be required if the charge were one of assaulting a police officer in the course of his duty. That, in my judgment, is the mens rea required for the element in the capital murder charge which referred to a member of the Garda Síochána acting in the course of his duty.&#8221;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">What, then, was the state of her mind? Its importance is that the test of her guilt for capital murder as well as murder must be a subjective one. The Court of trial was not entitled to judge her by what a reasonable person would have done in the circumstances, but it was entitled to evaluate what she did in the light of what she must have adverted to at the time&#8221;. </font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">56.	The test of recklessness in this context is well stated in the Model Penal Code drawn up by the American Law Institute:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8216;A person acts recklessly with respect to a material element of an offence when he </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">consciously </font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct. The risk must be of such a nature and degree that, considering the nature and purpose of the actor&#8217;s conduct and the circumstances known to him, its disregard involves culpability of a high degree.&#8217; &#8221; (Emphasis added)</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">57.	It appears to me that, despite the extensive submissions made on this point at the trial by Mr. Murphy S.C., the prosecution continued to treat the offence as one which did not require any advertence by the defendant to the serious risk of death or harm. The prosecution expressly contended for an objective standard, saying, in reply to Mr. Murphy&#8217;s submission:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;The next point is made in relation to the second count, the substantial risk of serious harm. I say there certainly is always a substantial risk of serious harm if one deliberately strikes another a blow, and that comes within what is considered in the question of reckless endangerment.&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">58.	As already remarked, the learned trial judge in his charge to the jury did not at all advert to the question of the mental state required to constitute recklessness but rather bypassed the issue by simply quoting the words of the Act and analysing them in a way fundamentally similar to the analysis of the Court of Criminal Appeal, quoted above.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The contrast with manslaughter.</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">59.	The omissions referred to in the last section of this judgment are, in my opinion, all the more significant when one considers the very considerable degree of overlap between the charge under s.13 and the charge of manslaughter of which the defendants were both acquitted. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">60.	In </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Charleton et al</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, cited above, manslaughter is described as follows:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;Manslaughter occurs where the accused kills the victim in one of the following circumstances:</font>
<ul><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(1)	Intending to kill or cause serious injury while lacking self control to an act of provocation;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(2)	Being in a situation where he is entitled to use force against the victim or to use as more force than was objectively necessary but no more that he honestly believed to be necessary;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(3)	Where the death of the victim is caused by a criminally negligent act or omission;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(4)	By an assault;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(5)	By a criminal and dangerous act.</font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">61.	It is clear from a consideration of the facts of this case, summarised at the start of this judgment, that the manslaughter alleged here fell into the fourth and/or fifth category and that, for the purpose of this case they overlap because the &#8220;criminal and dangerous act&#8221; can only be the assault alleged. Equally, the same assault is the &#8220;conduct&#8221; relied upon for the purpose of the charge under s.13 of the 1997 Act. There is, therefore, a huge overlap on the facts between the two charges. Moreover, the state of mind alleged against the defendants appear to be the same in each case, recklessness. So complete is the overlap between the charges that, but for one factor, I would consider the conviction on the s.13 charge to be inconsistent with the acquittal on manslaughter. This saving factor is that of causation, considered at some length above. There was, as the Director pointed out at the hearing of this appeal, genuine scope for the jury to be unconvinced that the action in question caused the death of the deceased.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">62.	That, in my opinion, is in the circumstances of this case sufficient to prevent the conviction of s.13 from being logically and legally inconsistent with the acquittal of manslaughter.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Another aspect of the Charge.</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">63.	There is a further difficulty in relation to the learned trial judge&#8217;s charge to the jury in this case and it is one which, having regard to the nature of the evidence adduced in support of the prosecution, may be significant. The learned trial judge told the jury that if &#8220;two views were equal&#8221; the defendants were entitled to the benefit of the doubt which would thus arise, so that the view favourable to them or either of them should be adopted in preference to another tendering to favour the prosecution. This form of charge is an erroneous one and the error resides in the suggestion that two views must be &#8220;equal&#8221; presumably in the sense of equally plausible or probable, before the prisoners entitlement to &#8220;the benefit of the doubt&#8221; arises.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">64.	The law on this subject was exhaustively discussed in the Court of Criminal Appeal (the judgment is that of Kenny J.) in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">The People (Attorney General) v. Douglas Byrne</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1974] IR 1. The Court followed the High Court of Australia arriving at the following formulation, on p.9:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;The correct charge to a jury is that they must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused, and it is helpful if that degree of proof is contrasted with that in a civil case. It is also essential, however, that the jury should be told that the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt and that when two views in any part of the case are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">possible</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> on the evidence, they should adopt that which is favourable to the accused unless the State has established the other beyond reasonable doubt.&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	(Emphasis added)</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">65.	Moreover, at p.5, the Court cited with approval the speech of Viscount Sankey in the leading case of </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Woolmington v. DPP</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1935] AC 462 at 481 as follows:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;If, at the end of and on the whole of the case, there is a reasonable doubt, created by the evidence given by either the prosecution or the prisoner, as to whether the prisoner killed the deceased with a malicious intention, the prosecution has not made out the case and the  prisoner is entitled to an acquittal&#8230; if the jury are either satisfied with his explanation or, upon a review of all the evidence, are left in reasonable doubt whether, even if his explanation be not accepted, the act was unintentional or provoked, the prisoner is entitled to be acquitted.&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">66.	These passages make clear that it is a grave misstatement of the law to say that the defendants&#8217; entitlement to the benefit of the doubt arises when two views (presumably those advanced by the prosecution and the defence respectively) are equally plausible. That is simply not true. It is sufficient from the defence perspective if the view upon which the defendant relies is a reasonably possible view, because the existence of a (reasonably) possible view consistent with innocence necessarily and coercively indicates the ground for reasonable doubt as to guilt.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">67.	The Court of Criminal Appeal has on a number of occasions recently drawn attention to the importance of properly delivering the charge required by </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">A.G. v. Byrne</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">; the self same error which was made here as was made in a number of recent cases. The significance of the error will depend very much on the nature of the case. In the present case where a significant part of what the jury had to do was to assess the plausibility of the defendant Cagney&#8217;s account of, in effect, acting in self defence. It would be indeed serious, and pregnant with the possibility of error, to approach it on the basis that his entitlement to the benefit of the doubt arose only if his account was equally plausible as that on which the prosecution relied.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">68.	The foregoing discussion is, however, obiter since no point was taken on this deficiency in the charge in the Grounds of Appeal.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Conclusion.</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">69.	The unfortunate fact is that neither the prosecution nor the learned trial judge at any time referred to the necessity to establish advertence by the defendants or either of them to the serious risk which the prosecution were alleging in order to bring home a charge under s.13 on the basis of recklessness. They failed to address this important issue notwithstanding that it was the subject of elaborate submissions addressed on behalf of the defence. This is, in my view, a grave defect in the trial affecting both defendants, since it obviated the need for the jury to address the question of the respective defendants&#8217; state of advertence or the lack of it which it was legally necessary for the jury to address. On that basis I would quash the convictions. In all the circumstances of the case, notably the fact that it is now more than seven years since the tragic incident at Portobello Bridge, the general good character of the accused and the fact that one of them, as the Court was informed by Mr. Murphy S.C. without contradiction, has in the meantime suffered devastating injuries in a road traffic accident, I would not order a retrial.</font>
