<b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Judgment of Mr Justice Finnegan delivered on the 30th day of July 2008</font></u></b><br>
<br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	This matter comes before the court by way of a Case Stated from the respondent pursuant to the provisions of section 5(2) of the Valuation Act 1988 upon a request in writing addressed to the Chairman of the Tribunal dated 27th September 2000 by the appellant, it being dissatisfied with the determination of the Tribunal of the 20th September 2000 and having expressed dissatisfaction to the Tribunal immediately after the determination of the appeal.  The appellant being dissatisfied with the decision of the High Court on the Case Stated brings this appeal.</font><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The Case Stated</font></u></b><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In the 1995 Quarterly Revision of Valuation Lists the valuation of the hereditaments mentioned in the title hereof were amalgamated and a rateable valuation thereof assessed at £1,200.  Notice of Appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation was lodged against this assessment in November 1995 which resulted in the rateable valuation being increased to £1,725.  On the 9th December 1996 an appeal by the appellant against this valuation was lodged to the Tribunal.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The hereditament the subject matter of the valuation can be divided into two</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">sections.  The first consists of buildings and ancillary stores including a crushing plant, a boiler room, a filtration area and physical housing for timber vats and in respect of this there is no dispute.  The second consists of fifty six tanks or vats used by the appellant as part of its cider production plant at Clonmel, Co. Tipperary.  The remainder of the appellant&#8217;s production plant is situate some distance outside Clonmel.  There are fourteen wooden vats within buildings on the hereditament which are separately rated.  The appeal to the Tribunal relates to twenty two wooden vats, fourteen concrete vats and twenty stainless steel vats.  The appellant&#8217;s submission throughout the appeal process up to this appeal was that the valuation is bad in law and invalid as the vats constitute either machinery or non-rateable plant.  Before this court the appellant submitted that the vats constitute non-rateable plant.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The relevant statutory provisions are as follows.  The Annual Revision of Rateable Property (Ireland) Act 1860 section 7 as substituted by the Valuation Act 1986, section 7 deals with machinery as follows:-</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;7(1)(a)  In making the valuation of any mill or manufactory, or building erected or used for any such purpose, the Commissioner of Valuation shall in each case value the water or other motive power thereof, but shall not take into account the value of any machinery therein, save only such as shall be erected and used for the production of motive power.</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(b)	For the purposes of this subsection, machinery erected and used for the production of motive power includes electrical power connections.&#8221;</font></i><br>

<ul>
<ul><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Plant is dealt with in section 7(2) of the 1860 Act as substituted by the Valuation Act 1986 section 7 as follows:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;7(2)	The Commissioner of valuation shall value plant falling within any of the categories of plant specified in the schedule to this Act (inserted by the Valuation Act, 1986).&#8221;</font></i></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The relevant category of plant for the purposes of section 7(2) is that in the schedule to the 1860 Act inserted by section 8 of the Valuation Act</font><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> 1986 </font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">at Reference No. 1 which provides as follows:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;All constructions affixed to the premises comprising a mill, manufactory or building (whether on or below the ground) and used for the containment of a substance or for the transmission of a substance or electric current, including any such constructions which are designed or used primarily for storage or containment (whether or not the purpose of such containment is to allow a natural or chemical process to take place), but excluding any such constructions which are designed or used primarily to induce a process of change in the substance contained or transmitted.&#8221;</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The Tribunal determined:-</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(a)	that the tanks or vats did not constitute machinery within the meaning of section 7 of the Annual Revision of Rateable Property (Ireland) Amendment Act 1860 as amended by section 7 of 	the Valuation Act 1986.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(b)	that the tanks or vats did not fall within the proviso in Reference no. 1 in the schedule to the said Act of 1860 inserted by section 8 of the Valuation Act 1986.</font><br>

<ul>
<ul><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The questions of law referred to the High Court are as follows:-</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(i)	Whether the findings of fact made in the judgment of the Valuation Tribunal issued on 20th September 2000 are supported by the evidence.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(ii)	Whether the Tribunal erred in law in determining as it did.</font><br>

<ul>
<ul><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The High Court answered the questions as follows:-</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(i)	Yes.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(ii)	No.</font><br>
<br>
<b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The Appeal</font></u></b><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The appellant&#8217;s Notice of Appeal raises ten grounds.   As argued the appeal centres on the decision of the learned High Court judge to uphold the determination of the Valuation Tribunal that the vats fell within the category of rateable plant created by Reference No. 1.  It is not disputed that the vats are constructions within the meaning of that reference.   The issue accordingly is whether the vats are designed or used primarily for storage or containment or designed or used primarily to induce a process of change in the substance contained.   If the former the vats are rateable and if the latter they are not.  While the vats may be designed or used for more than one purpose there can only be one primary purpose and that is what will determine their status as rateable or non-rateable.  In the present case it is now agreed that design is irrelevant in that the appellant does not contend that the vats contain any particular design characteristic:  the questions raised accordingly are to be answered in terms of the use to which the vats are put.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The Valuation Tribunal in its judgment issued on the 20th September 2000 fairly stated the issue as follows:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;As above stated the crucial question, which is one of mixed fact and law, is whether such vessels are designed or used primarily for storage or containment or are so designed or used primarily to induce a process of change in the substance contained therein.&#8221;</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The question is to be answered on the facts as found by the Valuation Tribunal.</font><br>
<br>
<b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The facts as found by the Valuation Tribunal</font></u></b><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The Valuation Tribunal set out the facts in the Case Stated as follows:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;(2)(a)	The Appellant company, in its business the biggest in Ireland, specialises in the production of cider both for the home and export markets.  It has as above stated part of its production plant at Clonmel, both East and West of Dowd&#8217;s Lane.  This lane on the northern side joins Mitchell Street and the Quay on the southern side.  It is narrow in all directions but more so at its northern extremity.  The remainder of the appellant&#8217;s production plant and its bottling plant is situate at Annerville outside Clonmel.</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(b)	The hereditament, the subject matter of this appeal, commenced its operation in its original form in 1938 and has developed segmentally since then.  The property comprises an old warehouse building which houses the original timber vats used in the production process, together with a filtration area and boiler room.  This building is constructed with brick and rubble masonry walls, concrete floor and a combination of roof coverings including slates, corrugated asbestos and metal decking.  Eaves height is c.25ft.  Immediately adjoining the building are concrete tanks which were installed during the mid 1950s.  These vessels are constructed of mass concrete walls, bitumen lined internally, with asphalt covered concrete roof and vary in height from 20 ft to 35 ft.  Opposite the original building on the eastern side of Dowd&#8217;s Lane is the crushing plant and apple yard, together with a three storey recently constructed building accommodating staff, canteen and toilet facilities.  The crushing plant is constructed with concrete walls and steel decking, concrete floor and barrel type corrugated iron roof.  The new three storey building immediately fronting the crushing plant is constructed with concrete block walls, concrete floors and asbestos slated roof.</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(c)	In 1992, on two different occasions, in order to help satisfy the companies stated policy of having a two year stock of cider available, the appellants applied for and subsequently were granted planning permission to erect 20 stainless steel tanks,.  These tanks are cylindrical in shape with heights varying from 25 to 40 feet.  11 have outer steel cladding.</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(d)	In all there are 22 timber vats, 14 concrete tanks (now disused) and as stated 20 stainless steel tanks.  For these said tanks/vats the parties have given slightly different capacity figures.  The numbers as between the appellant company and the respondent respectively are as to the stainless steel tanks 1.037 million/1.044 million gallons, as to timber vats 382,800 gallons/385,600 gallons and as to the concrete tanks, 789,200 gallons/791,486 gallons.  In addition the appeal valuer has also valued some wooden vats described as disused, with a stated capacity of 32,000 gallons.</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(e)	All of the vessels on site including these tanks are connected by a series of stainless steel pipe work of various diameters which are on both the inside and outside of the buildings and across Dowd&#8217;s Lane.  The finished product produced in Dowd&#8217;s Lane is a high strength 10% alcohol product and is then transported by road in bulk containers to the main Showerings Bottling Plant, located at Annerville on the outskirts of Clonmel, on the main Clonmel/Kilkenny road where it is diluted down to the appropriate alcoholic strength and bottled.</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(3)	Cider is made from apple juice.  The production and supply of apples is seasonal and therefore the vast majority of production has to take place during a short period of time.  Essentially, the production process, as given in evidence before us, can be described briefly as follows:-</font></i>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(a)	The cider making season starts in September when the apples are brought into the Dowd&#8217;s Lane plant.  The apples are first of all washed and then brought by way of water channel to a miller.  The apples are then milled (chopped up into very small pieces) and a pre-dosed amount of the milled apples put into what is called the &#8220;cheese&#8221; i.e. a wooden slat where a hair is put over the slat.   This is then built up into eleven wooden slats which then go into a hydraulic press.  The hydraulic press will then squeeze the juice from the actual milled apples.  There is a second pressing when the cheese is dismantled, the pumice is actually re-milled again and a second cheese built up so as to extract as much juice as possible from the apples.  The juice is then pumped to a 10,000 gallon wooden receipt vat.  During this process yeast will also be picked up, both fermenting yeast and non-fermenting yeast, from the hairs, from the vat and from the pipe work.  The 10,000 gallon receipt vat is used for this purpose.  Somax is added at this stage, and the purpose of the Somax is to eliminate undesirable yeast i.e. the non-fermenting type, leaving the fermenting type to carry out the subsequent fermentation.  Somax is sulphur dioxide which kills the non fermenting type yeast.  The fermenting yeast is generally the saccharomyces cerevisiae type.  The juice is allowed to stand in the 10,000 gallon receipt vat for approximately 24 hours to give time for the Somax to actually take effect.  The juice is pumped from the receipt vat into another vat which is the fermentation vat.  Fermentation then commences due to the yeasts that are present, that have been picked up during the actual crushing stage, during the transfer and by the tanks themselves.  At various stages during the fermentation starch hydrolysed, which is really sugar, is added.  This brings the gravity back up and allows the appellant to ferment to quite high alcohol, nearly up to 10% alcohol.  Starch hydrolysed is added in three or four different additions through the fermentation.  At this stage, as well, biopectinase is added.  It is an enzyme which will break down pectin because pectin, if not broken down, will cause filtration problems subsequently.</font></i>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The main purpose of the receipt vats are (a) to obviously pick up yeast and (b) as a measure, because they are 10,000 gallon tanks and (c) for Somax to be added.  The main purpose of the fermentation vat is for fermentation to take place, for starch hydrolysed to be added to bring the gravity back up and for biopectinase to be added.  Once all the additions have been made, the juice is then transpumped to a stainless steel tank, where the fermentation is ongoing until eventually all the sugar has been converted into alcohol.</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Once the fermentation vat is full, with all the various additions made, the fermentation at this stage will have got under way and will be progressing.  On a daily basis, samples will be taken for analysis, both sensory analysis and chemical analysis.  The chemical analysis is in respect of alcohol, gravity and acidity.</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Primary fermentation takes six to eight weeks until eventually all the sugar has been converted into alcohol.  It is then &#8220;dry&#8221; meaning that there is no sugar left.  During the fermentation, carbon dioxide is produced and released in the process.  In the timber vats there is an electrically operated extractor fan which will remove the carbon dioxide.  In the stainless steel vats, where the fermentation is actually finished, there are vent valves which will vent the carbon dioxide produced during fermentation to the atmosphere.  In the receipt vats, where the Somax is added and the fermentation vats where the biopectinase is added, there are manways at the top to allow for the addition of the Somax and the biopectinase;  Somax to the actual receipt vats and the biopectinase to the fermentation vats.  In the fermentation vats there are entry points so that the starch hydrolysed can be pumped in during the fermentation.  All these vats have these various accessories which are necessary to allow the process actually to be completed.  If the appellant did not have these they would not be able to make these additions and the end result would be an undesirable product.  </font></i></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(b)	Once the fermentation is finished, the yeast will then settle to the bottom which may take a week or two weeks.  Fermentation is then &#8220;racked&#8221; i.e. the supernatant is pumped to another vat.  One cannot leave the fermentation lying on yeast.  At this stage the yeast cells are dead.  If they break open or break up, they provide nutrients for micro-organisms to grow.  The process of racking takes place in January of each year after the period of primary fermentation is complete.  The racking takes place from the stainless steel vat, possibly into other stainless steel vats or possibly even into wooden vats, depending upon capacity and what is available.</font></i>

<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The cider at this stage is referred to as a green cider.  At this stage it would not be organoleptically suitable for obvious cider production, so it is left to mature over a period of approximately 8 to 15 months during which time a process known as malolactic fermentation occurs where malo acid is converted into lactic acid. This reduces the acidity of the cider and gives rise to a more complex flavour.  This turns the green cider (i.e. cider just after fermentation) into a more mature cider which is subsequently used to make the bulk blend.  Organoleptic analysis is carried out by a trained sensory panel which evaluates the ciders on a monthly basis.  The prime purpose is to make sure that the ciders, when they go forward for final packaging, are satisfactory from a sensory point of view, and they are also meant to be able to detect any undesirable change in the cider which will be caused by bacterial action.</font></i></ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">If the sensory panel picks up a deterioration of the cider, then a decision has to be made to use that cider by blending with good cider or to remove or mask the off flavour that would be developing. The organoleptic analysis is carried out on a monthly basis to make sure that the cider is consumable at the end of the process.</font></i></ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Aside from malolactic fermentation, there are also other subtle changes taking place that will eventually transform it into a product which is then satisfactory for cider production.</font></i></ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The appellant starts using ciders approximately eight months after fermentation and up to fifteen months thereafter, because there are fermentations coming off all the time.  The first fermentations will start in September, so the first ones starting in early September finish some time in October, and so on.  So there is always fermentation starting and finishing.	</font></i></ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">By the time you come to the end of the season, by the time the first fermentations are used, it is approximately eight months after the end of fermentation, going right on to approximately fifteen months at the end of fermentation.  Thus, while the average period for secondary fermentation (malolactic fermentation) is four or five months, the whole fermentation process is going on for a period of somewhere between eight to fifteen months.</font></i></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(c)	The next step is filtration where the ciders are filtered by microfiltration from one vat to the other.  The purpose of microfiltration is to remove yeast.  There will still be quite a lot of yeast left.  Even though the product has been racked, the product will still be hazy, and the only filer that will remove these without clogging is microfiltration, which is a new type of filtration process.  The product is pumped from the vat into a balance tank and it is then pumped from the balance tank through the actual microfilter.  The microfilter is really a concentration process where yeasts are concentrated into a thick sludge which is then pumped away, and the actual microfiltered product is then transferred to another tank where the maturation process will continue until such time as the product is ready to be blended.   This is approximately eight to fifteen months after fermentation.</font></i>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The product would just be microfiltered once although the microfilter is continuously being concentrated and if there are yeasts in it, will eventually end up as a sludge.  But once the product goes through the actual filters themselves, it is then just transferred on as a filtrate into a receipt vat.  Microfiltration will remove all yeasts.  Subsequently they may pick up some yeast again from storage, from vats, pipes etc., but the numbers will be quite small.  There is an actual filtration plant from which the cider is pumped from a tank to the plant and then back to another tank.  It is the pump that provides the motor force to move the cider from a vat to a filtration plant and then back to another vat.  The process is characterised by constant movement of the material.  The microfilter area will always be in action.  Once one fermentation has been filtered through, the next fermentation is coming through, followed by the next one.  There is constant movement even though the filtration only acts on any one lot of fermentation once.  It would be very rare to have to micofilter a given batch again unless there was significant secondary yeast growth.</font></i></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(d)	The next stage is the production of what the appellants call a bulk blend which is fresh juice cider.  This is then blended with a concentrate cider at a ratio of 50/50 and is then brought through another filter, a sheet filter.  The purpose of this is to remove any remaining yeast which may have been picked up during the final maturation process.  The product is then filtered into a stainless steel tank.  It is at this stage ready to go forward for the final production of actual finished cider.  Thus, there are two types of filters.  There is a microfilter unit and it will only filter through that once (save for exceptional occasions where it may be microfiltered twice).  Thus, the product will be racked once, will be microfiltered once and will go though the sheet filtration once.</font></i>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The same quantity is not being repeatedly subjected to the same process.  But there is continuous movement within the plant.  There are fermentations moving from the fermentation vats into the stainless steel vats so that the fermentations can be finished, there is racking from one tank to the next, there is movement then of racked product to the balance tank for microfiltration, and then there is movement post microfiltration when the cider is being blended.  So there is constant movement.</font></i></ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">There are some 375 movements occurring between vessels in the production of the total annual output which varies between 2 million and 2.5 million gallons.  The process requires the use of force so in all cases pumps would be used to pump the cider from one tank to another or from the vat to the balance tank prior to microfiltration, and also during the blending operation, obviously, where the product would be pumped into a tank where it is blended with the concentrate.</font></i></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(e)	   After the fresh juice fermentation is blended 50/50 with the concentrate fermentation and filtered through a sheet filter into a stainless steel tank, the product is then transferred to a tanker which brings the product up into the Annerville site, outside Clonmel, and that is then used to make the various ciders,.  The product would be at high strength, 10%, and that would be diluted down to whatever is the alcoholic strength of the product one is bottling.  Thus, it is not at bottling strength at the stage it leaves Dowd&#8217;s Lane and is diluted further in Annerville.  The product then goes through a bottling, canning or kegging process, depending on the nature of the final product.&#8221;</font></i><br>

Commissioner of Valuation</font></i></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> unreported the High Court Kelly J. 24th February, 1999.  In the former Hamilton CJ set forth the approach which the courts should take when asked to interfere with the decision of an expert administrative tribunal:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;They should be slow to interfere with the decision of expert administrative tribunals.  When conclusions are based on an identifiable error of law or an unsustainable finding of fact by a tribunal, such conclusions must be corrected.  Otherwise, it should be recognised that tribunals which have been given a statutory task to perform and exercise their functions as is now usually the case with a high degree of expertise and provide coherent and balanced judgments on the evidence and arguments heard by them, it should not be necessary for the courts to review their decisions by way of appeal or judicial review.&#8221;</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In the latter Kelly J. at p. 27 said:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;There is no doubt but that the Valuation Tribunal is the type of body which Hamilton CJ had in mind when expressing the views which I have just quoted from his judgment in the Denny case.  In the instant appeal, the Tribunal consisted of its Chairman, who is a senior counsel, and two deputy chairmen, one is a barrister and the other is a fellow of the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors.  This court should be slow to interfere with its decisions.  It should only do so on the basis of an identifiable error of law or an unsustainable finding of fact.&#8221;</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">On the issue which arises on this appeal on behalf of the appellants it was submitted that the respondent&#8217;s conclusion comprises a finding of fact which is unsustainable or alternatively a finding of fact which no reasonable Tribunal could have reached on the evidence.  The Tribunal misunderstood the nature of the process of fermentation and it failed to take into account the various mechanical processes of filtration and the pumping of liquid from one container to the other.  The Tribunal&#8217;s conclusion that the vats are used primarily for storage or containment and not to induce a process of change is unsustainable.  The evidence overwhelmingly is that the use of the vats was primarily to induce a process of change in the apple juice.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The learned trial judge held that it was difficult to accept that there was no evidence before the Tribunal to justify its finding that the primary use to which the vats are put is for storage or containment notwithstanding that they are also used to induce a process of change in the substance contained.  He held that the finding of the respondent was neither illogical nor irrational.  Insofar as the conclusions of the Tribunal can be classified as inferences to be drawn from primary facts found the appellant had failed to satisfy the court that those inferences from the findings of fact were such that no reasonable Tribunal could arrive at.   In the alternative if the conclusions of the respondent can be characterised as determinations of law no error of law had been identified such as would enable the court to interfere with the Tribunal&#8217;s decision.  The learned trial judge accordingly answered the questions raised on the case stated as follows:-</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">1.	Yes</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">2.	No</font><br>
<br>
<b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Submissions on the Appeal </font></u></b><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">1. The Appellants Submissions</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> The relevant distinction is that between constructions used for the containment of a substance including such as are used primarily for storage or containment (whether or not the purpose of such containment is to allow a natural or a chemical process to take place) and constructions used primarily to induce a process of change in the substance contained: more simply the distinction is between constructions used primarily for storage or containment and constructions used primarily to induce a process of change in the substance contained therein.  This was accepted by the Tribunal.   However the question that the Tribunal ultimately posed for itself and answered was different.  Para. 24 the Tribunal&#8217;s judgment reads:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;There is no dispute between the parties but that fermentation takes place naturally.  This over a six to eight week period.  This results in the production of alcohol and carbon dioxide which is extracted.  Sugar is from time to time pumped into the vats.  But apart from the extraction of the carbon dioxide and the infill of sugar nothing else is involved in converting apple juice into what is called green cider.  To achieve this, it is of course essential to have a structure or vessel or a series of structures/vessels within which the juice is contained.  It would appear that the timber vats are more suitable for this than the other vessels.  Whatever, can it be said in these circumstances that the process or the process of change which undoubtedly takes place is dependent upon or caused by the vessel being designed or being used primarily to induce that process or is it more accurate to advance the proposition that once containment of the apple juice is achieved then what follows, whether it be a natural or chemical process, is essentially, as a consequence of that containment with little else?  In our opinion if this is an acceptable manner of setting up the question, the facts, if accurately outlined, fall far short of satisfying the legal criteria for applying to this fermentation process the proviso contained within Reference No. 1.&#8221;</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The question is not, it is submitted whether a process of change is caused by the vessel being used primarily to induce the process.  This formulation suggests that there should be something inherent in the design of the construction that brings about the process of change and there is no such requirement in the wording of the statute.  The true construction of Reference No. 1 is that all structures within the provision whether within the exclusion or not are by definition used for containment: the question is what is the purpose of that containment.  If the purpose is to induce a process of change then the construction is within the exclusion in this case the purpose was to induce fermentation converting the juice into cider and accordingly the vats come within the exclusion.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The concentration by the Valuation Tribunal on the design of the vats or their innate characteristics apparent in para. 24 of the judgment is consistent throughout: in para. 19 the Tribunal stated that it was necessary to look at the design of the plant in question.  In para. 25 it suggested that the removal of residual yeast and bacteria could not change &#8220;the character of these vessels&#8221;: in para. 26 it is stated:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;It seems to us almost inescapable that these vessels are used or designed primarily for storage or containment and not to induce a process of change.  If it were otherwise not only would a process of change take place but there would be some means or method inherent in the structure itself which would induce that process&#8221;. </font></i><br>
</ul>
</ul>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> </font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">It was never suggested by either side that the design or character of the vats is relevant: the issue relates to their use.  That use is containment for the purpose of inducing a process of change.  There is no basis in the statute for reading in a further requirement that the container must possess a special characteristic bringing about the process of change.  There is inducement in that the process is not entirely natural in that Somax, starch hydrolysed and biopectinase are added and the liquid is repeatedly moved from one tank to another and this is inconsistent with mere storage or containment.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The appellant relied upon </font><b><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Irish Refining plc v Commissioner of Valuation</font></i></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> [1995] 2 ILRM 223.  That case concerned the distinction in the 1860 Act between machinery and plant and was not concerned with Reference No. 1 and I do not find it of assistance.

<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;15.	In applying the above principles where appropriate to the facts of the instant case we find it necessary to make a distinction between the tanks which hold the raw milk and the tanks which contain the skimmed milk.  In respect of the latter three tanks we are perfectly satisfied that what goes into those tanks is skimmed milk and what comes out is likewise the same skimmed milk &#8230; To have available skimmed milk is of course necessary for the manufacturing process which in turn means that the company must make available a facility to hold or contain that milk until such time as the process is ready to receive it.  Such a holding takes place primarily if not exclusively for storage or containment and certainly not either primarily or at all to induce a process of change.  Any activity which takes place within these tanks does so for the purposes of retaining or maintaining the skimmed milk in its original condition &#8230; accordingly we hold that these tanks are plant and are rateable as such within Reference No. 1 of the schedule to the 1860 Act.</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">16.	The position in our view is quite different with regard to the five tanks which hold raw or whole milk.  As above stated it is crucial to the operations of the appellant company that a certain specification (in terms of fat and protein content) is met whether that specification is customer orientated or required by law.  One way or another unless the specification is satisfied the ultimate product is of no use and certainly of no commercial viability &#8230; This is but one example of why the mixing and blending of raw milk with the skimmed milk and the processes which take place within these tanks are crucial to the entire manufacturing operations of the appellant company.  Whilst it is true to say that milk goes into these five tanks and that milk comes out, that statement without qualification is inaccurate and is certainly an incomplete description of the activity that takes place within.  What in fact goes in is raw milk which has a certain ascertainable percentage of fat and protein content and what comes out is not that milk with that content but rather milk with a quite different content of both fat and protein.  It is neither raw milk in its natural state or skimmed milk in its natural state.  It is a product different from both.</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">17.	Could we test this proposition by rhetorically asking whether or not, if there was no requirement for storage and if the manufacturing process so permitted, could the raw milk as delivered by the four co-operative societies be pumped straight into the manufacturing process and avoid altogether these tanks.  From the evidence of Mr. Holland (the appellants production manager) we are quite satisfied that this could not take place.  Accordingly it is our view and we so find that in respect of these five tanks the same are designed or used primarily to induce a process of change in the milk contained therein and as such are non rateable plant within the meaning of the aforesaid Reference No. 1.&#8221;  </font></i></ul>
</ul>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The appellant derived the following propositions from the foregoing:-</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">1.	Where the change taking place within a construction is itself a proximate part of the manufacturing process the purpose of the containment is unlikely to be storage.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">2.	Where the substance that comes out of the construction is different in character from the substance that goes in it is likely that the purpose of the containment is to induce a process of change.  </font>
<ul><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">3.</font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	A fortiori</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> when the substance that comes out, being different from that which goes in, is an essential element in the manufacturing process the purpose of the containment is unlikely to be storage.  In the present case what goes in to the vats is milled apples and the substance that comes out is high strength cider that is brought elsewhere for further processing.  The vats are not used to store or contain their contents in a particular condition in preparation for the core manufacturing process but rather are a part of the manufacturing process.</font></ul>
<br>
<b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The Respondent&#8217;s Submissions</font></u></b><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The respondent submits that there is no identifiable error of law or unsustainable finding of fact in the judgment of the Tribunal.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	</font><b><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Irish Refining plc v Commissioner of Valuation</font></i></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> was concerned with the interpretation of section 7 in its original version and not with section 7 as substituted by the Valuation Act 1986 section 7.  The original section 7 and section 7 as substituted differ substantially.  The onus is on the appellant to establish that they come within the exclusion: </font><b><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Caribmolasses Limited v The Commissioner of Valuation</font></i></b><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> </font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">[1994] 3 I.R. 189. </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	At para. 18 of its judgment the Tribunal correctly stated the issue:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;As above stated the crucial question, which is one of mixed fact and law, is whether such vessels are designed or used primarily for storage or containment or are so designed or used primarily to induce a process of change in the substance contained therein.&#8221;</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">While the appellant accepts this as the crucial question it nonetheless seeks to focus on the purpose of the containment rather than the use.  The Valuation Tribunal however makes it clear that if the vats are used primarily for storage or containment the fact that the purpose of such containment is to allow a natural or a chemical process to take place is irrelevant.  This will not confer an exemption from rateability.  The exclusion from rateability arises where the construction is designed or used primarily to induce a process of change.  The Tribunal at para. 24 of its judgment correctly stated the issue.  In this case:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220; &#8230; can it be said &#8230; that the process or the process of change which undoubtedly takes place is dependent upon or caused by the vessel being designed or being used primarily to induce that process or is it more accurate to advance the proposition that once containment of the apple juice is achieved then that what follows, whether it be an actual or chemical process, is essentially as a consequence of that containment with little else &#8230;&#8221;</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	</font></i><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The question to be answered is whether the vats are used primarily for storage or containment or primarily to induce the process of change.  On the evidence the primary purpose of the vats is to allow a natural process to take place.  Notwithstanding that additives are used during containment the vats do not induce the process of change in that they are entirely passive and merely store their contents.  While additional yeast is picked up during containment it cannot be said that the vat is thereby inducing a process of change.  The primary use is containment.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	In its judgment the Tribunal found:-</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">1.	There is no dispute between the parties but that fermentation takes place naturally over a six to eight week period which results in the production of alcohol and carbon dioxide, which is extracted.  Sugar is from time to time pumped into the vats, but apart from the extraction of the carbon dioxide and the infill of sugar nothing else is involved in converting apple juice into what is called green cider.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">2.	The fact that residual yeast and bacteria are removed cannot change the character of these vessels nor can the fact that maturing and blending occurs, which incidentally is effected by the passage of time and by the pumping through pipes of essentially the same product, namely cider. </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">3.	There is no distinction between the design, construction, use and purpose of any of the tanks above mentioned.  All are multi purpose and capable of being freely inter-changed in the production process.  That being so it is difficult to conclude that they were designed or used primarily to induce a process of change in the apple juice contained therein.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">4.	Given the critical necessity of containing the apple juice, of holding cider until despatch and of storing a sufficient quantity to accord with the company&#8217;s policy of having a two year stock available, it is almost inescapable that these vessels are used or designed primarily for storage or containment and not to induce a process of change.   </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	These are findings of fact on the evidence available to the Tribunal.  There was ample evidence for the Tribunal to conclude that the vats were not used primarily to induce a process of change in the substance contained but rather were used primarily for storage or containment.  </font><br>

<b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Discussion</font></u></b><br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The design of the vats is not in issue and the focus on this appeal is on their use.  Having regard to the wording of Reference No. 1 it seems to me that the issues to be determined can be reduced to the following two questions:-</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">1.	Are the vats used primarily for storage or containment whether or not the purpose of such containment is to allow a natural or a chemical process to take place?</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">2.	Do the vats fall within the exclusion in Reference No. 1:  they will be within the exclusion if they are used primarily to induce a process of change within the substance contained.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The following matters are not in dispute:-</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(a)	The vats are plant as defined in section 1 of the Valuation Act 1986.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(b)	The vats are constructions for the purposes of Reference No. 1.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(c)	The design of the vats is not relevant to the issue to be decided.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In construing Reference No. 1 particular regard must be had to the following words and phrases therein:-</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(a)	&#8220;containment&#8221; and &#8220;storage&#8221;.</font><br>

<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Bearing the foregoing in mind, applying selective comminution to Reference No. 1 results in its relevant provisions reading as follows:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> &#8220;All constructions used for the containment of a substance including such      constructions which are used primarily:</font></i></ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>

<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">containment (whether or not the purpose of such containment is to allow a natural or a chemical process to take place) </font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">but excluding any such constructions which are used primarily to induce a process of change in the substance contained.&#8221;</font></i></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Containment is a category of use and in the absence of any contrary indication is to be given its ordinary meaning.  Included within that category, but without prejudice to the ordinary and more general meaning, are three sub-categories:-</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(a)	use primarily for storage.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(b)	use primarily for containment.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(c)	use primarily for containment where the purpose of such containment is to allow a natural or chemical process to take place.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The effect of section 4 of the 1860 Act and the schedule inserted therein by section 8 of the 1986 Act is to bring plant within Reference No. 1 and thus liable to a charge to rates unless the plant comes within the exclusion therein.   Thus constructions used primarily to induce a process of change in the substance contained are not liable to a charge for rates as plant.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Turning now to the words and phrases to which I have indicated particular regard must be had it is clear that the focus is on use unless the purpose of that use is expressly or by implication made relevant.  Containment is a use.  The purpose of the containment is expressly made relevant where the purpose is to allow a natural or chemical process to take place.  The purpose is implicitly relevant in &#8220;storage&#8221; which in its ordinary meaning connotes containment against future use and in the present context containment until required for use in the appellant&#8217;s production process.  If the primary use of the vats is storage or if the primary use of the vats is containment whether or not for the purpose of allowing a natural process to take place the vats will be liable to a charge for rates. They will be within the exclusion if they are used primarily, not for containment, but to induce a process of change in the substance contained.  The focus of the inquiry therefore is on use: in two circumstances the purpose of the use is relevant, firstly in relation to storage and secondly use primarily to induce a process of change.</font><br>

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Any process of change induced is relevant for the purposes of the exclusion:  only a natural or chemical process allowed to take place is relevant to the charging provision.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The task of the Tribunal was to find the primary use of the vats.  It found, and there was indeed no dispute, that fermentation takes place naturally. This is a finding of primary fact.   Thus whether the vats are used primarily for storage, for containment or for containment for the purpose of allowing that natural process to take place, the vats will be liable to a charge to rates.   If the vats come within the exclusion as being used primarily to induce a process of change they will not be liable to a charge to rates as plant.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The evidence is that there is constant movement between vats and that the vats are used interchangeably throughout the process.  The appellant has a policy of storing two years stock within the vats.  The total annual output of the plant varies between 2.0 million and 2.5 million gallons.  On the appellant&#8217;s figures the total capacity of the stainless steel vats is 1.037 million gallons, of the timber vats 382,800 gallons and the concrete tanks 789,200 gallons.  It is stated that the concrete vats are unused.  The total capacity of all three types of vats is approximately 2.2 million gallons or excluding the concrete vats 1.2 million gallons.  As there is continuous movement between the vats it cannot be said that any particular vat is used exclusively for storage.  If the stated policy of storing two years supply is observed, even in part, some of the capacity is used for storage and the remainder used for containment while the natural process of fermentation takes place.  It is, however, not possible on the findings of fact to determine the proportion of capacity used for each of the purposes storage or containment.  The total capacity of the vats in use roughly equates with the total annual production.  The process from receipt of apples involves a period of six to eight weeks for primary fermentation followed by racking to remove yeast after which the cider is left to mature over a period of eight to fifteen months during which malolactic fermentation occurs.  The product is filtered normally on two occasions but occasionally on a third occasion.  The process is continuous.  Having regard to the capacity of the vats actually used and taking an average production period from apple to product suitable for transfer to the Annerville site and assuming the constant introduction of apples at the start of the process and the drawing off of product at the end of the process there would appear to be little capacity available for use as pure storage.   Accordingly the vats are used primarily for containment while a natural process of fermentation occurs whether that process is allowed or induced. This being so the Tribunal, accepting that some of the capacity is used for storage, rightly concentrated on whether:-</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(a)	the vats are used primarily for containment for the purpose of allowing the natural process of fermentation to take place or</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(b)	used primarily to induce a process of change in the substance contained.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">It is clear that a construction may have more than one use.  In the present case vats may be used for storage or for containment while fermentation takes place.  The conclusion reached on the evidence by the Tribunal is that the process of change which takes place is a consequence of the containment with little else and that the vats accordingly are not used primarily to induce that process.  Part of the capacity is used primarily for storage.  There was ample evidence before the Tribunal to support this finding.  The process of change takes place over a period of six to eight weeks for primary fermentation followed by a period of secondary fermentation over a period of eight to fifteen months. During this total period there are a number of interventions.  Somax is added, biopectinase is added and the fermentation vat is racked &#8211; the supernatant is pumped to another vat.  These processes consume a minute portion of the total time which the entire process of change takes.  For the rest of that time the use to which the vats are put is that of containment for the purpose of allowing the natural process to take place.  That is the primary use.   Even if it could be said that the interventions which I mention induce a process of change it would be necessary to consider whether the primary use is containment or such inducement.  This would not affect the position as the primary use remains that of containment for the purpose of allowing a natural process to take place the interventions merely resulting in the product resulting from fermentation being more suitable for the appellant&#8217;s purposes.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The authorities opened to the court are of limited assistance as each case will turn on the findings of fact in that particular case.  </font><b><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Caribmolasses</font></i></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> </font><b><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Company Limited v Commissioner of Valuation</font></i></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> concerned tanks used for the containment and blending of molasses and the issue was whether or not they came within the exclusion.  The Tribunal held that the tanks were designed or used primarily to induce a process of change in molasses and so came within the exclusion and on a Case Stated the High Court upheld that decision.  The Supreme Court held that the process within the tanks whereby molasses of varying viscosity was blended to form a uniform mix is not a process of change:  even if it could be said to be a process of change it is not induced by the tanks which are simply used to contain the molasses while blending is effected.  The judgment is of no assistance in the present case.</font><br>
<b><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Irish Refining Plc v Commissioner of Valuation</font></i></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> was concerned with whether sections of plant at the oil refinery at Whitegate were machinery and therefore exempt from rating.  The court was concerned with the law prior to the amendment of the 1860 Act by the 1986 Act.  The decision is, however, of some limited relevance in that it supports the Tribunal&#8217;s approach in determining the primary use of the vats.  At p.226 Geoghegan J. said:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;The fact that tanks or receptacles are fitted with equipment which enables some activity to take place within does not necessarily alter their character as tanks and convert them into machines.  To repeat the expression used by McCarthy J. in the </font></i><b><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Siúcra Éireann</font></i></b><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> case, if the character of the tank &#8216;predominantly is one for storage purposes&#8217; it is a tank and not a machine.&#8221;</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Applying that approach in the present case one looks at the process within the vats as a whole and the intervention by the addition of Somax and biopectinase and the process of racking in the context of the same to determine whether what occurs within the vats is primarily a natural process which is allowed or a process of change which is induced.  It was open to the Tribunal on the evidence before it to find that the former is the primary use.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	I am satisfied that the constructions come within the charging provision being used primarily for storage or containment and do not come within the exclusion as they are not used primarily to induce a process of change in the substance contained.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">There is nothing in the judgments in the foregoing cases to dissuade me from the view which I have formed as to the construction of Reference No. 1 both in its charging provision and in the exclusion.  </font><br>
<br>
<b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Decision</font></u></b><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The tanks or vats do not fall within the exclusion in Reference No. 1 in the schedule to the Act of 1860 inserted by section 8 of the Valuation Act 1986.  No issue as to whether the vats constitute machinery within the meaning of section 7 of the Annual Revision of Rateable Property (Ireland) Amendment Act 1860 as amended by section 7 of the Valuation Act 1986 arose before this court.  I would therefore answer the questions raised on the Case Stated</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(i)	Yes.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(ii)	No.</font><br>
