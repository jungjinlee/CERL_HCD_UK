<b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Judgment of Mr Justice Finnegan delivered on the 23rd day of January 2009</font></u></b><br>
<br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The respondent issued a plenary summons against the appellants on the 26th March 1996.  In the endorsement of claim he sought damages for defamation, injurious falsehood and negligent misstatement.   There was delay in service of the plenary summons and a statement of claim was not delivered until the 10th September 1998.  The reliefs claimed in the statement of claim are damages for malicious and/or injurious falsehood, defamation and conspiracy.  By notice of discontinuance dated the 11th August 1998 the action was discontinued against the third named appellant.  Pursuant to an order of the court an amended statement of claim was delivered on the 26th March 2001.  The relevant facts are set out in paragraphs 4, 5 and 8 of the amended statement of claim as follows:-</font><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">4.	In or about the period between 29th June 1992 and 26th October 1992 and thereafter until and about May 1995 a series of phone calls of a malicious and defamatory nature were made on behalf or at the behest of or with the knowledge and acquiescence of the first named defendant from phone lines and telephone apparatus in Classiebawn Castle, Mullaghmore, Co. Sligo, i.e. from the phone numbers 071-66455, 071-66491 and 071-66326 which telephone lines were listed in the names of Tunney Meats Limited and/or Hugh Tunney as subscriber.  Phone calls of a similar nature were made from phone lines and telephonic apparatus in the Gresham Hotel, Dublin, i.e. from phone lines now with the number 01-8748145, which telephone lines were listed in the name of Hugh Tunney c/o The Gresham Hotel.  The said phone calls were made to the same parties as the aforementioned phone calls.</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">5.	In these phone calls a female caller had claimed that Sherry, a criminal associate of a convicted drugs trafficker and with excellent sources within the Garda, was part of a money laundering operation on behalf of the I.R.A. and that monies were cleansed through an Irish company called Princeton Limited.  It was alleged that a co-director of Princeton Limited was Chief Superintendent Paul Smyth of the Garda (being the plaintiff herein).  It is alleged that Chief Superintendent Smyth had actively inhibited any enquires about Sherry and associates, allegedly by misuse of his authority whilst head of personnel by transferring &#8216;troublesome&#8217; officers.  The phone calls in question were made to the South East Regional Crime Squad of the British Police Forces at (inter alia) New Southgate branch office, 143 High Road, London N1 1PM (phone number 181-3685100) and were received by Detective Inspector Stephen Condon and Detective Constable Paul Edwards.</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">8.	The allegations made in these phone calls were notified to An Garda Siochána by the British Police Forces concerned which led to an investigation by An Garda Siochána to the prejudice, damage and detriment of the plaintiff.&#8221;</font></i><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">On the 11th February 2003 the respondent issued a motion seeking the following reliefs:-</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;1.	An order granting the plaintiff liberty to withdraw the notice of discontinuance of the 11th August 1998 as against the third named defendant and liberty to proceed within proceedings as against the third named defendant.</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	2.	An order grant the plaintiff liberty to deliver an amended statement of   claim in the form attached hereto.</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8221;</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> The motion was grounded on an affidavit of the plaintiff.   Therein he deposes that a defence had been delivered by the first named defendant but no defence had been delivered by the second named defendant.  He deposes as to the reason for the discontinuance of the action against the third named defendant as follows:-</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;The reason for the discontinuance is that the calls were made by the   said Ms Devine either on her own behalf or on behalf of Mr Tunney and while she may also have made them on behalf of Crofter Properties Limited it seemed unnecessary at that time to involve Crofter Properties Limited in order to vindicate my reputation.  Proving that Ms Devine acted on behalf of Crofter Properties Limited seemed a burden which I need not take on with any associated risk of costs.&#8221;  </font></i></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">On the 9th July 2002 the Supreme Court in a decision in an action Crofter Properties Limited v Genport Limited held that Ms Devine, made the calls not only on her own behalf but also on behalf of Crofter Properties Limited.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Consequent on the withdrawal of the notice of discontinuance the statement of claim would require amendment.  However in addition the respondent sought to amend his claim by including claims arising from similar type telephone calls made to the Revenue Commissioners and Phoenix Magazine.  The respondent became aware of these telephone calls as a result of discovery made in the action Crofter Properties Limited v Genport Limited.  No leave was sought at any time to avail of this discovery for the purposes of the present proceedings.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	By order of 29th January 2004 the High Court (O&#8217;Sullivan J.) gave the plaintiff liberty to withdraw the notice of discontinuance and liberty to deliver an amended statement of claim as sought and against that order the appellants now appeal.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	</font><br>
<br>
<b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Withdrawal of the Notice of Discontinuance</font></u></b><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The respondent in the High Court relied on two Canadian cases </font><b><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Adam v Insurance Corporation of British Columbia </font></i></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">[1985] 66 B.C.L.R. 164 and </font><b><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Pacific Centre Limited v Microbase Development Corporation</font></i></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">, unreported,19th September 1990, Hynes J.  In this court reliance was placed on the former.  In that case the plaintiff instituted proceedings seeking damages for personal injuries sustained when a bus in which he was travelling was in collision with a car against both the bus driver and the owner and operator of the bus company and the unidentified owner and driver of the car.  Shortly before the trial date the action against the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia was discontinued as the plaintiff&#8217;s counsel believed that the action was barred by the combined effect of the Insurance (Motor Vehicle) Act and Regulations relating to the Workers Compensation Board.  .  Her counsel later learned of an unreported decision which indicated that the relevant Regulation might have been </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">ultra vires </font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">and as a result sought and obtained an order setting aside the discontinuance.  At that time the plaintiff&#8217;s action was statute barred.  The defendant appealed against the order setting aside the discontinuance.  The issue in the action was whether the court had a discretionary power to set aside the notice of discontinuance and if so whether that discretion had been properly exercised.  The British Columbia Court of Appeal held that it had power to set aside the notice of discontinuance but that it should not have been done in that case.  The relevant rules of court contained no provision for setting aside a notice of discontinuance.  In the course of his judgment Esson J.A. referred to four Canadian cases.  In three of those cases the defendant had intended to counterclaim but had not launched a counterclaim before the plaintiff discontinued and it was held that the defendant had been prejudiced in that it was not then in a position to assert the right which it had wished to put forward by way of counterclaim.  In each of those cases it was held that there was no power to set aside a notice of discontinuance.  However in </font><b><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Cusack v Garden City Press Limited</font></i></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> [1978] 22 O.R. (2d) 126 (S.C.) the plaintiff applied to set aside a notice of discontinuance.  The matter was heard before a Master.   In the course of his judgment he said:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;I feel that it must always be open to the court in proper circumstances to relieve against an act done either by way of inadvertence or misapprehension and that this should be particularly so where no real prejudice to the other side is demonstrated.&#8221;</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The circumstances in the case were as follows.  The plaintiff sought an interlocutory injunction and failed. His lawyer then filed a notice of discontinuance.  The plaintiff retained other lawyers and from that point on the notice of discontinuance was disregarded and the matter was fully pleaded.  The defendant then took the position that the action was not properly constituted because of the notice of discontinuance.  The plaintiff swore that he had not authorised his lawyer to take any step by way of discontinuance.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Esson J.A. categorised the </font><b><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Cusack</font></i></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> case as one in which the discontinuance was not the act of the plaintiff but also one in which there were clearly acts on the part of the defendant taken with knowledge that there had been a discontinuance which would amount to a waiver of any rights.  This distinguished the case from that before him.  In </font><b><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Cusack</font></i></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> the word &#8220;misapprehension&#8221; must have been intended to refer to misapprehension by the plaintiff&#8217;s original lawyer as to his instructions.  In the case before him there was no misapprehension and no mistake and no inadvertence but rather a considered decision by the plaintiff to terminate the action.  He went on to hold that the court must have an inherent jurisdiction over its own process and there must be a discretionary power to relief against the consequences of discontinuance without attempting to catalogue the circumstances which would justify the exercise of that power.  He held that the circumstances must be very special and may not go beyond the kind of inadvertence, mistake or misapprehension which existed in the </font><b><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Cusack</font></i></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> case.  Further in the case before him the limitation period had expired after the discontinuance and the effect of setting aside the notice would be to give a cause of action which would otherwise be clearly statute barred.  He allowed the appeal.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	O&#8217;Sullvian J. accepted that the Statute of Limitations having regard to the nature of the torts relied upon might not in this case have run against the respondent.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	This decision does not appear to me to advance the respondents case.  There was no question of inadvertence or mistake but rather a deliberate decision not to proceed against the third named defendant with a view to minimising the risk as to costs.  The present case falls outside the very limited sphere in which the inherent jurisdiction envisaged by Esson J.A. would operate.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The learned High Court judge was not referred to any authorities other than the Canadian authorities which I mention.  This is not an area devoid of authority.  Order 26 Rule 1 of the Rules of the Supreme Court in England and Wales was identical to Order 26, Rule 1, in the Rules of the Supreme Court (Ireland) 1905.  Order 26, Rule 1, was repeated in the Rules of the Superior Courts 1962 and again repeated in the Rules of the Superior Courts 1986 with an amendment not relevant here relating to discontinuance on consent.  Excluding that amendment Rules of the Superior Courts 1986 provide as follows:-</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	</font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;The plaintiff, may at any time before receipt of the defendants defence, or after the receipt thereof before taking any other proceeding in the action (save any interlocutory application), by notice in writing in the Form No. 20 in Appendix C wholly discontinue his action against all or any of the defendants or withdraw any part or parts of his alleged cause of complaint, and thereupon he shall pay such defendant&#8217;s costs of the action, or, if the action be not wholly discontinued, the costs occasioned by the matters so withdrawn.  Such costs shall be taxed.  (The plaintiff may, however, at any time prior to the setting down of any cause for trial wholly discontinue his action, with or without the costs to be paid by any party, upon producing to the proper officer a consent in writing signed by all parties or by their solicitors and such costs (if any) shall be taxed).  Such discontinuance or withdrawal as the case may be shall not be a defence to any subsequent action.&#8221;</font></i><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	In England and Wales the Rules remained identical with some amendments not material to this case up to the introduction of the Civil Procedure Rules in 1998.  Accordingly decisions of the Courts in England and Wales while not binding are persuasive.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	A starting point as to the law in this jurisdiction is Wylie on the Judicature Acts.  At page 437 he states that Order 26, Rule 1, forms a complete code as to the discontinuance of an action or the withdrawal of a defence or counterclaim and cites as authority </font><b><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Fox v Star Newspaper Company</font></i></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> [1898] 1 Q.B. 639 a judgment of the Court of Appeal.  That judgment was upheld by the House of Lords reported at (1900) A.C. 19.  The rule in issue in that case is identical to that in the 1905 Rules.  Chitty L.J. in the Court of Appeal said:-</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	</font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;It seems to me that order XXVI is intended to form a complete code applicable to the whole subject of discontinuing an action.&#8221;</font></i><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">This view of Order 26, Rule 1, persisted in England and Wales &#8211; service of a notice of discontinuance put an end to the action but without prejudice to the right of the plaintiff to institute fresh proceedings on the same grounds but subject to an exception where service of a notice of discontinuance was an abuse of the court&#8217;s process when the discontinuance could be set aside on application by the other party to the cause.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	In </font><b><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Castanho v Browne and Root (U.K.) Limited </font></i></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">[1981] A.C. 557 the facts were as follows.  The plaintiff, a Portuguese, resident in Portugal, sustained injuries in an accident when employed by the second defendant, a Panamanian company, on an American ship lying in an English port.  Proceedings were instituted in England seeking damages for the injuries.  On consent two interim payments were made to the plaintiff and a defence delivered admitting liability.  The plaintiff then commenced an action in Texas and discontinued the English action.  The American proceedings if successful would result in a greatly enhanced award by way of general damages and punitive or exemplary damages.  In the High Court Parker J. held that the notice of discontinuance was in these circumstances an abuse of the process of the court and struck out the notice of discontinuance and injuncted further prosecution of the proceedings in Texas.  The Court of Appeal by a majority (Shaw and Brandon L.JJ., Denning M.R. dissenting) allowed an appeal against both orders.  In the High Court Parker J. and in the Court of Appeal Denning M.R. in his dissenting judgment held that it is possible to treat a notice of discontinuance which complies with the Rules of Court as an abuse of process and that the court has jurisdiction to strike it out.   The House of Lords agreed.  The House of Lords thus established an exception to the general rule that Order 26, Rule 1, was a complete code and that as the rule did not provide for the striking out of a notice of discontinuance the court had no power to do so.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	In </font><b><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Ernest and Young v Butte Mining Plc</font></i></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> [1996] 1 All E.R. 623 Robert Walker J. said:-</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	</font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;Discontinuance is the process by which a plaintiff (or plaintiff by counterclaim) may put an end to the whole of his claim and the proceedings in question.  It has featured in the Rules of the Supreme Court for well over a century, having superseded all the procedures such as non-suit or voluntary dismissal of a bill in chancery (see </font></i><b><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Fox v Star Newspaper Company Limited</font></i></b><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> [1900]  A.C. 19)&#8230;a plaintiff&#8217;s apparently unfettered right to discontinue before or within fourteen days after the defence is, however, subject to the overriding rule that discontinuance will not be permitted if it is an abuse of process.&#8221;</font></i><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The issue in </font><b><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Ernst &amp; Young</font></i></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> was whether or not in the particular circumstances the discontinuance was an abuse of process.  The defendant had intimated an intention to counterclaim.  There were discussions between the plaintiff&#8217;s and the defendant&#8217;s solicitors.  Both solicitors were aware that if the action should be discontinued prior to the service of the counterclaim the counterclaim would not survive there being no action in existence at the date of service.  The plaintiff&#8217;s solicitor agreed to discuss the terms upon which the action should continue, that is the counterclaim, after the discontinuance while all times her intention was to discontinue and rely on the discontinuance to defeat the intended counterclaim as at the time of discontinuance the statute would have run against the defendant and the plaintiff would have had a defence on the basis of the statute against any proceedings subsequently instituted by the defendant.  In holding that the service of the notice of discontinuance in these circumstances was an abuse of process Robert Walker J. said:-</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	</font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;Heavy, hostile commercial litigation is a serious business.  It is not a form of indoor sport and litigation solicitors do not owe each other duties to be friendly (so far as that goes beyond politeness) or to be chivalrous or sportsmanlike (so far as that goes beyond being fair).  Nevertheless, even in the most hostile litigation (indeed, especially in the most hostile litigation) solicitors must be scrupulously fair and not take unfair advantage of obvious mistakes:  see the decision of the Court of Appeal in </font></i><b><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Darby and Co. Limited v Weldon </font></i></b><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(No. 8) [1990] 3 All. E.R. 762 (this was not cited by counsel but the general principle is, I think, uncontroversial).  The duty not to take unfair advantage of an obvious mistake is intensified if the solicitor in question has been a major contributing cause of the mistake.&#8221;</font></i><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	While the issue was determined on the basis of abuse of process the circumstances come closer to those in which equity would grant relief, that is, fraud, accident or mistake,.  However, no case has been cited in this or in neighbouring jurisdiction where a notice of discontinuance has been struck out on such a basis.  Abuse of process is narrower in scope than the equitable principles in that it concerns the inherent power of the court to prevent misuse of its procedure in a way which although not inconsistent with the literal application of its procedural rules would nevertheless be manifestly unfair to a party to the litigation or would otherwise bring the administration of justice into disrepute.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	</font><b><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Gilham v Browning &amp; Another</font></i></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> [1998] 2 All E.R. 68 also concerned the striking out of a notice of discontinuance for abuse of process.  In the course of his judgment May L.J. said:-</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	</font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;It is, of course, important to recognise on the one hand that the court uses a jurisdiction to strike out for abuse sparingly and in plain cases where there has been misuse of the court&#8217;s process, and on the other that the court is not constrained by fixed categories of circumstances in which the court has this power.&#8221;</font></i><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	There are many other cases reported to like effect:  see </font><b><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Hunter v Chief Constable of West Midlands</font></i></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> [1981] 3 All E.R. 727 at 729 and </font><b><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Fakih Bros v A.P. Moller (Copenhagen) Limited</font></i></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> [1994] 1 Lloyd&#8217;s Rep. 103.  The cases consistently recognise that the rule does not provide for the withdrawal of a Notice of Discontinuance by the party who has served the same.  The court has not been referred to any case in this jurisdiction or in England and Wales where this has been permitted.  There is no report of such case in either jurisdiction recognising an inherent jurisdiction to do so.  Even if such jurisdiction should exist this is not a case in which it should be exercised.  The decision to serve the notice of discontinuance was a conscious and advised one.  The withdrawal of the notice of discontinuance at this stage would likely deprive the third named appellant of a defence of the Statute of Limitations.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Having regard to the foregoing I would allow the appeal and set aside the order of the High Court which gave leave to the respondent to withdraw the notice of discontinuance.</font><br>
<br>
<b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Amendment of Statement of Claim  </font></u></b><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Exhibited on the application was an amended form of statement of claim.  Many of the amendments are in anticipation of the third named appellant being re-joined in the action as a result of withdrawal of the notice of discontinuance.  Clearly these are no longer relevant.  In addition however the respondent seeks to rely on the</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">additional publication to Phoenix magazine and the Revenue Commissioners and it is necessary to consider whether these amendments should be permitted.  In short the respondent seeks to plead new facts and on foot of these to recover damages on the basis of the original causes of action pleaded.  In addition the respondent seeks to add additional causes of action namely:</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(i)	wrongful interference with economic interests of the plaintiff;</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(ii)	negligence and breach of duty.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The application is made pursuant to Order 28 Rule 1 of the Rules of the Superior Courts which provides as follows:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;The court may at any stage of the proceedings allow either party to alter or amend his endorsement or pleadings in such manner and on such terms as may be just, and all such amendments shall be made as may be necessary for the purpose of determining the real questions in controversy between the parties.&#8221;</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Order 28, Rule 1, was considered by the High Court in </font><b><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Krops v Irish Forestry Board Limited</font></i></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> [1995] 2 I.R. 113.  The plaintiff&#8217;s wife was killed in an accident when the car in which she was travelling was struck by a falling tree.  Proceedings were instituted claiming damages arising out of her death, which it was pleaded, was caused by the negligence, breach of duty and breach of statutory duty of the defendants.  The plaintiff sought leave to amend the statement of claim by the insertion of the words &#8220;and nuisance&#8221;.  Keane J. (as he then was) considered the law in England and Wales under the Rules of the Supreme Court 1965 Order 20 Rule 5 and went on to consider whether as a matter of principle the same approach should be adopted in this jurisdiction.  Since </font><b><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Weldon v Neal</font></i></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> [1887] 19 Q.B.D. 394 both in England and Wales and in this jurisdiction an amendment would not be permitted if it would deprive the defendant of a defence under the Statute of Limitations.  However in England and Wales in </font><b><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Chatsworth Investment Limited v Cussins (Contractors) Limited </font></i></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">[1969] W.L.R. on considering the new rule of court held that </font><b><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Weldon v Neal</font></i></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> should not be applied in its full vigour and that an amendment should be allowed whenever it is just to do so even though it may deprive the defendant of a defence under the Statute of Limitations. There were a number of conflicting decisions. Ultimately the controversy was resolved by legislation in favour of a more liberal approach to amendment.  Having considered the English authorities Keane J. dealt with the Irish rule as follows:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;Treating it as a matter of principle, I think one can start by positing a somewhat extreme set of circumstances.  A person is injured in a traffic accident and issues proceedings within the limitation period.  In his statement of claim, he described the accident as having happened at O&#8217;Connell Avenue, Finglas, Co. Dublin.  In fact, the point at which the accident occurred is in the City of Dublin.  A pedantic counsel asks the court to permit an amendment of the statement of claim.  At this stage, the limitation period is run. The trial judge allows the amendment notwithstanding that the limitation period has expired, on the ground that </font></i><b><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Weldon v Neal</font></i></b><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> has no application as neither a new cause of action nor any new facts of any significance are being added.</font></i></ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">It is obvious that in such a case the defendant is not deprived of any defence under the Statutory of Limitations 1957:  he never had such a defence in the first place since the plenary summons and statement of claim were issued within the limitation period.  That example simply serves to illustrate that the pleadings which initiate an action in this court carried with them from the time they are issued or delivered the potentiality of being amended by the court in the exercise of its general jurisdiction to allow a party to amend his endorsement of claim or pleadings &#8216;in such manner and on such terms as may be just&#8217;.  Where, as here, an amendment, if allowed, will not in any way prejudice or embarrass the defendant by new allegations of facts no injustice is done to him by permitting the amendment.   In that sense, it is true to say that the amendment does not in truth deprive him of a defence under the Statute of Limitations 1957:  since the proceedings were always capable of amendment in such manner as might be just in order to allow the real question in controversy between the parties to be determined, it cannot be said that the defendant was at any stage in a position to rely on the Statute of Limitations 1957.</font></i></ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The evolution of the law in the neighbouring jurisdiction demonstrates, I think, that the difficulties that have arisen can be traced, no so much to the decision in </font></i><b><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Weldon v Neal</font></i></b><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">, as to an over-rigid application of the principle laid down in that case.  Where, as here, the plaintiff seeks to add a new cause of action arising out of &#8211; to borrow the words of the English rule &#8211; &#8216;the same facts or substantially the same facts&#8217; there seems no reason why this court, even in the absence of a corresponding rule in this jurisdiction, should be precluded from permitting such an amendment.</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> I will accordingly allow the amendment sought.&#8221;</font></i><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Order 28, Rule 1, was considered by the Supreme Court in </font><b><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Croke v Waterford Crystal,</font></i></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> [2005] 2 I.R. 383.  It was held that on an application to amend the first matter to be considered by the court is whether the amendment sought is necessary for the purpose of determining the real questions in controversy in the litigation.  The court will consider whether the amendment can be made without prejudice to the other party.  If the possible prejudice is exposure of the other party to additional expense that can be regulated by a suitable order as to costs.  A very late application to amend is less likely to succeed particularly if the amendment is a purely technical point.  </font><b><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Krops v Irish Forestry Board Limited</font></i></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> was expressly approved of.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In summary the law as to amendment now is that an amendment will be allowed if it is necessary for the purposes of determining the real issues in controversy between the parties.  The addition of a new cause of action by amendment will be permitted notwithstanding that by the date of amendment the Statute of Limitations had run if the facts pleaded are sufficient to support the new cause of action.  Facts may be added by amendment if they serve only to clarify the original claim but not if they are new facts.  Simple errors such as an error in date or an error as to location which do not prejudice the defendant and enable the real questions in controversy between the parties to be determined will be permitted.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The amendment sought here by way of the addition of causes of action does not satisfy these requirements.  In order to sustain the new causes of action additional facts are required to be pleaded and indeed the notice of motion sought amendment of the statement of claim by the addition of the necessary pleadings of fact.  These amendments should be disallowed.  Similarly the amendment of the statement of claim by pleading additional facts relating to additional publication to the Revenue Commissioners and Phoenix Magazine should be disallowed.  The Statute of Limitations may well have run and the defendants would be prejudiced by the amendments sought as to additional publication.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">I would allow the appeal and refuse the plaintiff leave to withdraw the notice of discontinuance and refuse the plaintiff leave to amend his statement of claim.</font><br>
