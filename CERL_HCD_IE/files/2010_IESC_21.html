<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">JUDGMENT of Mr. Justice Hardiman delivered the 21st day of April, 2010.</font></b>
<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Background.</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">1.	In this case the appellants, all of whom are part of what I have described below as the &#8220;Murphy interests&#8221;, seek certain declaratory  reliefs and seek to quash by judicial review a decision of the Flood Tribunal of the 9th day of November, 2004, refusing them costs.  They also seek, if necessary, a declaration that s.6 of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act 1979 (hereinafter &#8220;the 1979 Act&#8221;) is unconstitutional.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2.	The Flood Tribunal, more formally the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments (hereinafter &#8220;the Tribunal&#8221;) which was established as long ago as 1997 and is still continuing, is one of the latest in a series of Tribunals of Inquiry established in this country.  It is established in the manner envisaged by the Tribunals of Inquiry Act 1921 as amended (&#8220;the 1921 Act&#8221;).  This Act is one of the very last Acts of the old United Parliament of Great Britain and Ireland. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3.	Though there have been Tribunals of Inquiry since the 1920s, the modern series of tribunals may be regarded as commencing with the Beef Tribunal of the early 1990s.  These tribunals, as this one amply illustrates, have become immense in their duration and, consequently, in their costs.  It is fair to say that both the length of the present inquiries and their cost were utterly unimaginable not only in 1921 but even in 1990 and in 1997.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">4.	I am unaware of any international comparator, even amongst States much richer than Ireland, whose public inquiries approach ours for length, complexity or expense, or who exhibit such readiness to have recourse to a tribunal.  This is to be deplored from every point of view.  I agree with the academic authority cited by Fennelly J. in his judgment in this case who said:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;The inquiry is inquisitorial in character, and often takes place in a blaze of publicity.  Very damaging allegations may be made against persons who may have little opportunity of defending themselves and against whom no legal charge is preferred&#8221;.</font>
<ul><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">and:</font></ul>
<br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;an inquisitorial public inquiry is not always easily controllable, and its evils would be grave if its use were not infrequent&#8221;.</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">5.	Equally, I wish urgently to recommend to those responsible for the establishment of tribunals a book &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Illinois Justice</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221; by Kenneth A. Manaster (University of Chicago Press, 2001).  This is an account of an inquiry presided over by the future U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens into suspected bribery by banking interests of Justices of the Illinois Supreme Court.  The inquiry began in mid-June 1969 and was over by the end of July 1969.  Stevens announced the terminal date before he began his work.  He insisted on the narrowest possible terms of reference.  He brooked no extension of them.  The cost of his six week inquiry was a miniscule fraction of any of our tribunals.  In his foreword to Manaster&#8217;s book, Justice Stevens contrasts this speed and economy with the &#8220;Special Counsel&#8221; inquiries subsequently established in the United States.  Yet none of the latter, to my knowledge, have extended to anything like as long as the present Tribunal.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">6.	Both the length and the cost of tribunals are due in part to the enormous powers which have been conferred on them.  They have power to require any person or body in the State to cooperate with them, to produce enormous volumes of documentation and to make themselves available to be questioned.  Confidentiality can be set aside and the privilege against self-incrimination does not apply.  Sometimes the cost of doing this which the individual or company must bear are themselves enormous.  It will not be reimbursed for years, if ever.  The tribunal may withhold any re-imbursement at all.  Furthermore, in recent times tribunals have taken to conducting a good deal of their work in private.  This means that the material they have obtained will normally be known only to the tribunal and may be selectively concealed from the parties.  This has proved enormously controversial in the past.  See the decision of this Court in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">O&#8217;Callaghan v. Mahon</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2006] 2 IR 32. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7.	If the powers of the tribunals are enormous, so too are the consequences of their deliberations.  We have seen people forced to leave public life, put to enormous expense and even imprisoned as a result of their interactions with the Tribunal.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">8.	In recent times too, attempts have been made to find cheaper and  less cumbersome ways of inquiring into matters of public concern than that provided by the Tribunal of Inquiry.  One of these has been the notion of a parliamentary committee.  This, indeed, is ironic since the 1921 Act was passed against a background where the previous preferred method of inquiry had been the parliamentary inquiry.  These, over a period of centuries, had transpired to be almost invariably corrupt or biased.  This unhappy history is summarised in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Maguire v. Ardagh</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2002] 1 IR 385.  This case also treats, to some extent, of the unhappy history of certain American congressional inquiries notably those carried out by the now notorious House Committee on Unamerican Activities.  For a detailed treatment of the most unfortunate history of British Parliamentary inquiries see Prof. George W. Keeton &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Trial by Tribunal; a study of the development and functioning of the tribunal of inquiry</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221;, London, Museum Press (1960).  In </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Maguire</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, a group of gardaí whose involvement in a chain of events in which an unfortunate man was shot dead was the subject of a parliamentary inquiry, succeeded in preventing the inquiry from taking place in a political forum.  This led to the establishment of the Barr Tribunal.  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">9.	Over the years, even the years since 1990, all sorts of people have taken issue with the powers which certain tribunals sought to exercise in their particular cases.  Some of these have been commercial interests but at different times gardaí, journalists, a Cardinal, solicitors, members of Dáil Éireann and even the Government of Ireland itself have sought to challenge the powers which a tribunal, commission or parliamentary committee proposed to exercise in their regard.  These challenges have given rise to a substantial body of case law, some of which will be referred to below. </font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Flood Tribunal and the Murphys.</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">10.	Of the various tribunals of the last two decades, the Flood Tribunal is by far the best known.  In part this is due to its unprecedented length (with the possible exception of its contemporary, the Moriarty tribunal). and its consequent unparalleled expense.  But it is also due in part to the very dramatic evidence which has been given before it and to the fact that certain prominent people have been very publicly ruined, and in some cases even imprisoned, as a result of their interaction with it.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">11.	Probably no part of the Flood Tribunal&#8217;s dealings have attracted more public attention than that featuring Mr. James Gogarty who made allegations of the most serious kind against his former employers, the appellants herein, and others.  The destructive effect of these allegations on individuals, the flamboyance of Mr. Gogarty as a witness and his striking gift for phrase-making have all contributed to this.  One of his phrases, indeed, may fairly be said to have entered the vocabulary of Hiberno-English. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">12.	In other words, the political and social impact of the Tribunal has been enormous and is beyond doubt.  Equally, its unique capacity to damage, even to ruin, individuals is well established.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">13.	The appellants herein, who for reasons shortly to be explained I shall refer to as the &#8220;Murphy interests&#8221;, have been before this Tribunal principally or solely because Mr. Gogarty made allegations against them.  Their involvement was involuntary: they were compelled to become involved in the Tribunal, to make discovery or disclosure of huge quantities of material at enormous expense to themselves and to participate in the sittings of the Tribunal for the huge span of 163 sitting days over a period of several years.  After all that, the Tribunal made findings adverse to them: they were found to have been involved in the making of corrupt payments and to have &#8220;obstructed and hindered&#8221; the Tribunal. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">14.	On the basis of these findings, when they applied to recover some of the enormous costs they had been put to, they were refused both on the basis of the Tribunal&#8217;s substantive findings and its findings in relation to &#8220;obstruction and hindrance&#8221;.  Furthermore, they are on notice that at a future sitting of the Tribunal it will be urged that the Tribunal, of its own motion, should make the Murphy interests liable, to a greater or lesser degree, for the costs incurred by other interests, or for the costs of the Tribunal itself.  This is plainly capable of amounting to a truly enormous financial imposition. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">15.	The Murphy interests make a number of complaints about this state of affairs.  They say that the Tribunal had simply no power to make findings of &#8220;obstruction and hindrance&#8221; in relation to them.  Secondly, they say that even if the Tribunal had such power in principle, it had no power to make these findings in the manner that it did, which they say was grossly unfair and breached their entitlement to fair procedures.  They also say that the process whereby these findings were arrived at was grossly defective and unsustainable in law or in elementary logic.  One of the allegations of breaches of fair procedures they make is that they were quite deliberately deprived of evidence which the Tribunal had in its possession and which might have enabled them (in the somewhat complex way described below) to avoid the findings of obstruction and hindrance.  They say that they were deliberately deprived of material which might have been absolutely explosive in its effect on the credibility of Mr. Gogarty.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">16.	The Tribunal says it was fully entitled to come to the conclusions that it did and to refuse costs to the Murphy interests.  They take a number of points which are more or less technical in nature (in relation to delay, relevance etc.) but more generally they claim that they were fully entitled to come to the conclusions that they did and indeed that they had to do so in order to exercise their statutory costs jurisdiction.  They admit that certain material was withheld from the appellants and further admit that it should not have been withheld but do not admit that the appellants suffered any disadvantage in that regard.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">17.	I now proceed to consider, in all necessary detail, the nature of this challenge and the answer made to it.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Costs and the Legitimacy of Tribunals.</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">18.	As noted above, certain persons have in the past been heard to complain, and to take their complaint to the courts, that the enormous prerogatives of a Tribunal of Inquiry is capable of destroying them, financially and in terms of reputation, much more obviously than even a criminal court could do, but that the tribunal&#8217;s procedures afford them few or none of the protections which would be available to them in the court forum.  This contention has always been rejected.  It was rejected in strong terms by this Court in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Goodman v. Mr. Justice Hamilton</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1992] 2 IR 542.  This decision is now the foundation, in Irish law, of the constitutionality of the Tribunal of Inquiry, as known in our law.  But since that judgment was given, the nature of tribunals in themselves has been altered, by legislation, by parliamentary resolution establishing or continuing certain tribunals including this one and by the exponential, and wholly unpredicted, expansion in the length of Tribunals of Inquiry and in the costs of them.  It would be wholly unrealistic not to acknowledge that these costs can only be described as truly enormous. 	</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">19.	The appellants here have been refused their own costs of (involuntarily) participating in the tribunal and of the vast discovery they made, (even though they were legally required to undertake this) and are on risk of having enormous costs awarded against them.  It was made clear in the course of this appeal that the State itself has &#8220;indirectly&#8221; applied for such an award of costs to be made.  Whether a tribunal empowered to make orders of such enormous financial consequence can nonetheless be described as being (as, on the authorities, tribunals must be) &#8220;incapable of imposing liabilities&#8221; &#8220;sterile of legal effect&#8221; on the basis that it merely expresses an opinion, and &#8220;this opinion is devoid of legal consequences&#8221;, is the most general of the issues raised by the appellant in these proceedings. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">20.	Other issues turn more narrowly on aspects of the remit, history and conduct of this particular tribunal.  The most notable of these is the admitted failure of the Tribunal to disclose to the Murphy interests certain material, which might fairly be described as explosive, relating to the statements made by or attributed to their principal accuser.  But it is important to note that the appellants have chosen to challenge, not the substantive findings which the Tribunal made adverse to them, but only the finding in relation to costs.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">21.	Findings gravely adverse to the Murphy interests were made by the Tribunal in its second interim report (issued on the 26th September, 2003) and its third interim report issued some fifteen months later on the 21st January, 2004.  The appellants&#8217; proceedings were instituted on the 20th April, 2004. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">22.	I use the phrase &#8220;the Murphy interests&#8221; because of what is said in chapter 17 at p. 141, para. 17-04 of the second interim report of the Tribunal under the heading &#8220;Co-operation with the Tribunal&#8221;:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;The findings made against Mr. Joseph Murphy Snr and Mr. Joseph Murphy Jnr apply </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">pari passu </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">to the companies within the Murphy Group to whom legal representation was granted including Joseph Murphy Structural Engineers Limited, Lajos Holdings Limited. The Grafton Construction Company Limited, Reliable Construction (Dublin) Limited, Barrett Developments Limited (in Liquidation), Turvey Estates Limited, Finglas Industrial Developments Limited (in Liquidation), Helmdale Limited (in Liquidation), Gaiety Stage Production Limited, Gaiety Theatre (Dublin) Limited, Finglas Industrial Estates Limited and Wexburn Limited&#8221;.</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">23.	Mr. Roger Copsley and Mr. Frank Reynolds appear also to have been identified with the appellants and their companies, and are included in the above phrase as used by me.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">24.	The appellants&#8217; complaints centered principally on the activities of the Tribunal concerning that aspect of its inquiries known as the &#8220;Gogarty Module&#8221;.  This related to allegations made by a Mr. Gogarty, formerly an executive with the Murphy Group, and in particular to an allegation that the appellants had made a payment in cash to the former Government Minister, Mr. Ray Burke.  It was specifically alleged that Mr. Gogarty and Mr. Joseph Murphy Junior had been present when this payment was made at Mr. Burke&#8217;s home in Swords, Co. Dublin, in 1989.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Issues</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">25.	Two key issues were raised on behalf of the appellants:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">(1) whether the Tribunal was entitled to take into account its substantive findings in adjudicating on the issue of costs and </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(2) whether the Tribunal was entitled to make findings of &#8220;obstruction and hindrance&#8221; against the appellants either (a) at all or (b) in the manner in which it did.</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">26.	The appellants&#8217; proceedings are directed exclusively, on (1) the costs order already made, refusing the appellants their costs, and (2) a further cost issue yet to be determined i.e. whether the appellants can be made to pay the costs of the Tribunal or of any other party.  As will be seen, certain of the points urged by the appellants would, if upheld, appear to have implications for the substantive findings of the Tribunal as well as for its power to grant or refuse costs orders.  However, the present proceedings focus exclusively on the costs issues.  This appears to be, firstly, because of the enormous expense to which the appellants have already been put and the risk of being forced to pay some or all of the equally enormous costs of other parties.  Secondly, on the basis of authorities to be discussed below, the appellants say that because costs orders represent a positive refusal of a benefit or entitlement or imposition of a liability, such orders, are outside the class of findings which a Tribunal of Inquiry may lawfully make, since such findings of a tribunal of inquiry are required to be &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">in vacuo</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221; and to be &#8220;legally sterile&#8221;.  The point was also made by counsel that the substantive findings against the appellants appear to turn on issues of credibility which it is difficult to ask a court to review, drawbacks less obviously present in an attack solely on the Costs order.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Findings and how they were arrived at.</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">27.	Leading counsel for the Murphy interests, Mr. Michael Cush S.C., referred to chapter 11 of the second interim report entitled &#8220;Gogarty Module&#8221;.  This is subtitled: &#8220;Payment of Money to Mr. Ray Burke T.D. at his Home at Briargate, Swords, Co. Dublin in June 1989 at a Meeting Attended by Mr. James Gogarty&#8221;.  This was very largely an issue of pure credibility and the Tribunal concluded at p. 77, para. 11 - 23 that:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;that the conflicts which are apparent from consideration of the evidence of the parties, could not be explained on the basis that they were innocent failures of recollection, mistakes, or misinterpretation of the true facts.  The Tribunal concluded that the divergences in the accounts given by the parties could only be explained on the basis that some party, or parties, had deliberately set out to mislead the Tribunal as to the true circumstances leading to the meeting with Mr. Burke and the payment of monies to him.  In broad terms the issue arising was whether the account given by Mr. Gogarty was true or whether the accounts given by all of the other persons present in Mr. Burke&#8217;s house at the time of the meeting were true.  Certain facts were common case namely (1) a meeting did in fact take place at the home of Mr. Burke in June, 1989, (2) Mr. Gogarty, Mr. Michael Bailey and Mr. Burke were present, (3) a substantial sum of money, amounting to not less than £30,000, was paid to Mr. Burke at this meeting partly in cash and partly by cheque and the majority of which was in cash.  The essential disputes between the parties arising from the evidence in relation to the JMSE funded payment were (1) whether this payment was made as a political donation, or as a bribe (2) whether this payment was made with the knowledge of the Murphy interests or not.&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">28.	From the appellants&#8217; point of view, the question of whether the payment was a political donation or a bribe was irrelevant and hardly arose at all.  Their case was that they knew nothing at all about it.  This, in turn, depended on the credibility of the witnesses on the issue of whether or not Mr. Joseph Murphy Junior was at the meeting.  He was adamant that he was not.  Only Mr. Gogarty said that he was.  It must always be  borne in mind that the meeting at which he was allegedly present was said to have happened in 1989; the evidence in relation to it was given about a decade later.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">29.	According to the Tribunal:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;Mr. Gogarty&#8217;s evidence was that Mr. Murphy Jnr. had attended three meetings in Dublin during the period between the end of May 1989 and the 15th June 1989.  The first of these meetings were said to have been a meeting &#8220;a couple of days&#8221; before the 8th June 1989 which took place at the premises of JMSE at Shanowen Road, Santry, and which was attended by Mr. Joseph Murphy Jnr., Mr. Frank Reynolds and Mr. James Gogarty, on behalf of the Murphy interests, and by Mr. Michael Bailey.  Mr. Gogarty said that it was at this meeting that Mr. Bailey spoke of his claimed ability to procure planning permission through the assistance of Mr. Burke, and certain named councillors and officials. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The second meeting was said to have taken place on the afternoon of the 8th June 1989, and was said to have been attended by Mr. Joseph Murphy Jnr., Mr. Frank Reynolds and Mr. James Gogarty, at which the assembled monies, intended to be paid to Mr. Burke, were counted out by Mr. Gogarty in anticipation of a visit to Mr. Burke&#8217;s home on the same date, a visit which was unexpectedly called off.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The third meeting some days after the 8th June 1989, was the meeting said to have taken place at Mr. Burke&#8217;s home which was said to have been attended by Mr. Michael Bailey, Mr. Joseph Murphy Jnr and Mr. James Gogarty, at which it is said that two envelopes were passed to Mr. Burke which were believed to contain £40,000 each, the first envelope being passed over by Mr. Joseph Murphy Jnr. and the second by Mr. Michael Bailey.&#8221;.</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">30.	These findings occur at p.129, paras 14-92 to 14-94 of the second interim report.  The issue before the Tribunal, in one sense, could not have been simpler.  As counsel for the appellants put it &#8220;the issue is whether we were there at all&#8221;.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">31.	It is, of course, very difficult indeed to establish anyone&#8217;s precise whereabouts on any given day a decade ago.  And even if one does, there is always a risk that one&#8217;s accusers will react by saying that their allegation really relates to a time less specific, &#8220;on or about&#8221; a particular day or something similar.  However, Mr. Joseph Murphy Junior focussed on the meeting of the 8th June, 1989 because he said he was in London on that day and was able to call witnesses who had telephoned him on the morning of that day in London and also that night in London.  In relation to an earlier date, he could show he had been in Waterford for part of the day.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">32.	The appellants complained that there was never a reasoned or evidence-based finding that Mr. Joseph Murphy Junior was at either meeting.  Instead, there were findings, to be quoted below, that he &#8220;could have&#8221; been there which then morphed, without further evidence, explanation or justification into a finding that he </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">was</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> there.  At p.130, para. 14 - 99 of the second interim report, it was held that &#8220;notwithstanding the alibi evidence offered in relation to Mr. Murphy Jnr&#8217;s meetings with friends in Waterford, a meeting </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">could have taken place</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> with Mr. Bailey on either the 31st May or 1st June and still have allowed Mr. Murphy Jnr. to attend his meeting in Waterford later on the 1st June&#8221;. (Emphasis added)</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">33.	In the following para. 14-100, the Tribunal expressed itself as follows:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;The Tribunal is satisfied that Mr. Murphy Jnr. could have attended a meeting in Dublin on the 8th June 1989 notwithstanding the evidence that he had received telephone calls in London both that morning and that night.  A meeting </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">could have taken place</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> at JMSE&#8217;s premises on the afternoon of the 8th June provided Mr. Murphy Jnr. had flown from London to Dublin and returned on the same day.&#8221; </font>
<ul><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(Emphasis added)</font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">34.	At p. 132, para. 14 -117 the Tribunal concludes &#8220;that the alibi evidence </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">does not prove</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that Mr. Joseph Murphy Jnr. </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">could not have attended</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> at least three meetings in Dublin between the 31st May and the 15th June 1989&#8221;. (Emphasis added)</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">35.	This, say counsel for the appellants, amounts to a reversal of the onus of proof.  It is certainly a striking double negative, not apparently a sound platform for the next mental leap in the findings.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">36.	Thus, in considering the allegation made by Mr. Gogarty in which he spoke of a series of meetings in or about the first half of June, 1989, and such evidence as Mr. Murphy Jnr. was able to assemble in relation to his movements at that time, the Tribunal first concluded that Mr. Murphy Jnr. &#8220;could have&#8221; attended those meetings or certain of them and secondly, in the passage as quoted above, that what the Tribunal called &#8220;the alibi&#8221; did not prove that he could not have attended them. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">37.	However, by the time it came to set out its findings at p.139, (chapter 16 &#8220;Summary/Conclusions&#8221;) the Tribunal said, at para. 16 - 17 that &#8220;[t]the parties present at the meeting [where the money was paid] </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">were </font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Mr. Burke, Mr. Michael Bailey, Mr. Joseph Murphy Jnr. and Mr. James Gogarty&#8221;. (Emphasis added).  At this point, &#8220;could have&#8221; has been first transposed into &#8220;can&#8217;t prove the contrary&#8221; and then to &#8220;was&#8221;, an unqualified positive finding of fact.  The seamless (to use Mr. Cush&#8217;s word), silent and unreasoned transition from bare possibility to an unqualified statement of fact seems possible only by a virtue of a reversal of the onus of proof.  No explanation whatever is offered of it.  This is unsatisfactory in itself.  The development in the findings from &#8220;could have&#8221; to &#8220;can&#8217;t prove the contrary&#8221; to &#8220;did&#8221; is an unreasonable one.  It is, in legal terms, irrational.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">38.	Mr. Cush alleged, and it was not denied, that the Tribunal moved from &#8220;could have attended the meeting&#8221; to &#8220;</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">did </font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">attend the meeting&#8221; without any intermediate stage, argument, evidence or linkage.  This process was, said Mr. Cush, entirely unargued and a finding that Mr. Murphy Junior attended the meeting seemed to follow seamlessly, in the Tribunal&#8217;s mind, from an initial finding merely that he &#8220;could have&#8221; attended the meeting.  Furthermore, the second interim report gives no indication as to why or how the appellants&#8217; account was rejected.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Consequences of the foregoing.</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">39.	Mr. Cush&#8217;s primary emphasis, however, was not on the findings summarised above in themselves, nor even on the question of whether the Tribunal&#8217;s process of reasoning, insofar as it appears from the second interim report, is capable of logically subtending the findings made.  Instead, Mr. Cush was concerned to illustrate the effect of the foregoing, not on the substantive findings of the Tribunal but on the findings it made as to whether the principal representatives of the Murphy interests had, or had not, &#8220;obstructed or hindered&#8221; the Tribunal and what, precisely, their attitude to it had been.  He then proceeded to follow the findings on these latter questions in turn through to the Tribunal&#8217;s decision on the costs issue it has already decided, by way of supporting his attack on that decision.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;Obstructed and hindered&#8221;</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">40.	In the case of Mr. Joseph Murphy Senior and Mr. Joseph Murphy Junior, the Tribunal found at pp. 144 to 145,  paras. 17 - 15 and 17 - 16 of its second interim report that each of them &#8220;obstructed and hindered the Tribunal&#8221;.  In the case of Mr. Joseph Murphy Junior, who was most directly involved, as the Tribunal found, in the &#8220;Gogarty Module&#8221;, this hindering and obstruction was said to consist of:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">(a) Failing to give a truthful account of the circumstances in which he came to attend a meeting at the home of Mr. Burke in June 1989 at which he handed to Mr. Burke a sum of not less than £30,000. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(b) Failing to give a truthful account of his dealings with Mr. Michael Bailey with regard to the participation proposal in which it was envisaged that Mr. Michael Bailey would receive 50% of the value of the Murphys&#8217; North Dublin lands in return for procuring planning permission and building bye law approval in respect thereof.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(c) Giving a false account of the involvement of Mr. James Gogarty in the sale of the Murphy lands and the role played by him in connection with the payment of JMSE monies to Mr. Burke.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(d) Giving a false account of his dealings with Mr. Michael Bailey subsequent to the publication of the Sunday Business Post articles.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(e) Falsely constructing an alibi which was untrue. </font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">41.	It will be apparent that matters set out at (a) and (e) above relate wholly to the &#8220;Gogarty Module&#8221; and the matters set out at (c) relate at least partially and probably wholly to it.  The other paragraphs related to connected transactions.  It will also be observed that what the Tribunal calls an &#8220;alibi&#8221; is what they earlier described as &#8220;alibi evidence&#8221; which was evidence that Mr. Murphy Junior was in London in the morning and evening of the day at which one of the controversial meetings, that of the 8th June 1989 took place and in Waterford on another date.  It will be remembered that the Tribunal had not previously found that this alibi was actually false or untrue.  It had simply been found that it did not exclude the possibility of Mr. Murphy Junior&#8217;s attendance at the relevant meeting.  This, in fact, is the same as saying that it was not an &#8220;alibi&#8221; at all.  It is clear that, though the &#8220;alibi&#8221; had not been found to be untrue in the earlier findings of the Tribunal, it has now in some way been found to be untrue without further argumentation or justification.  This conclusion is baldly stated in chapter 17 of the second interim report.  Again, this process evidences a lack of reasoning or rationality.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Third Interim Report.</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">42.	In the Tribunal&#8217;s third interim report further findings adverse to the Murphy interests were made by the Tribunal and there was, additionally, further findings of hindrance and obstruction against Mr. Joseph Murphy Junior.  These latter are to be found in chapter 8 at p.20 of the Third Interim Report.  The focus of the third interim report was primarily on payments allegedly made to Mr. George Redmond.  It is fair to say that most of the argument on the hearing of this appeal and almost all of the factual references with which it was supported, related to the second interim report.  But the two reports are inexplicably connected in terms of personnel, structure and otherwise: the contrary was not submitted.  Mr. Cush advanced many of the same criticisms in relation to unsupported mental leaps leading to the findings of hindrance and obstruction as has been summarised above in relation to the second interim report.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Legal significance of the term &#8220;obstructed and hindered&#8221;.</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">43.	At p. 141, para. 17 - 03 of its second interim report, the Tribunal had this to say:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;Any person, duly summoned to do so, who gives evidence to the Tribunal which is material to its inquiry, which that person wilfully knows to be false or does not believe to be true or who by act or omission </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">obstructs or hinders</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> a Tribunal in the performance of its functions, commits a criminal offence.&#8221; (Emphasis added)</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">44.	This is, in fact, a paraphrase of a statutory provision, discussed below.  The Tribunal&#8217;s words are quoted here so as to demonstrate that the substance and meaning of the statutory provision was present in the Tribunal&#8217;s mind when it made the findings of obstruction and hindrance, summarised above.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">45.	Moreover, in the preface to the second interim report, the Tribunal said:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;All citizens have a duty to co-operate and assist a Tribunal and to tell the truth when summoned to appear at a public hearing. It is with considerable regret that I have concluded that I must report, as one of my findings, that certain parties who appeared before me chose not to co-operate with the Tribunal in its task and further, having been duly sworn did not tell the truth.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The extent of which their actions may have involved them in breaches of the criminal law is a matter upon which the Director of Public Prosecutions has absolute and exclusive jurisdiction.  I have decided to forward a copy of my Report to him to take such steps, and to do with it, what he, in his absolute discretion, considers appropriate.&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">47.	Again, I quote this passage principally as evidencing the state of mind of the Tribunal.  However, it is necessary to point out, as will in any event be obvious, that the question of whether or to what extent any person involved in the Tribunal may have committed a breach of the criminal law is a matter, not for the Director of Public Prosecutions, but exclusively for the courts if and when the Director of Public Prosecutions or any other competent prosecutor initiates a prosecution.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">48.	The statutory provision referred to above is s.3 of the 1979 Act.  Insofar as relevant this provides as follows:</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;(3) The Principal Act is hereby amended by the substitution of the following subsections for subsection (2) of section 1:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">(2)	If a person - </font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">(a)-</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(b)-</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(c)-</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(d)by act or omission, obstructs or hinders the tribunal in the performance of its functions&#8230;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(e)-</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(f)-</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">the person shall be guilty of an offence.</font></ul>
</ul>

<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">(2A)(a)A person guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding £10,000 or at the discretion of the court to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both such fine and such imprisonment.&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">49.	When this statutory citation and the extracts from the second interim report quoted above are considered in light of the findings of the Tribunal in relation to the appellants it will be clear that the finding that: &#8220;Mr. Joseph Murphy Junior obstructed and hindered the Tribunal&#8221;, is a finding that Mr. Joseph Murphy Junior committed a criminal offence.  In light of the fact that the first way in which the Tribunal found that he obstructed and hindered the Tribunal was by &#8220;failing to give a truthful account&#8221; of a particular matter and the fifth way was by &#8220;falsely constructing an alibi which was untrue&#8221; it will be clear that the findings of the Tribunal amounted to a finding, not only of the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">actus reus</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of a criminal offence but also of the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">mens rea</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the offence, said to have been committed by a named person.  It is also a finding based entirely on the substantive findings and is indeed presented in substance as a corollary of them.  There is no basis for the &#8220;obstructed and hindered&#8221; finding other than the substantive finding.  This conclusion is neither logically nor legally valid.  Merely because one witness&#8217;s evidence is preferred to that of another does not mean, or imply, that the other has committed a criminal offence, whether of obstruction or hindrance or otherwise.  This proposition was not defended on this Appeal.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">50.	Whether a finding of this sort is one which it is proper for any Tribunal of Inquiry to make, or for this Tribunal to make in the circumstances in which it did, will be discussed below.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">51.	It is clear from the introductory portion of chapter 17 of the second interim report (at p. 141, para. 17 - 04) that, in the Tribunal&#8217;s mind, firstly, there existed an alternative option existed of making a finding of non-cooperation in lieu of a finding of hindrance and obstruction, and secondly that a finding, even of failure to co-operate &#8220;can have serious consequences both as regards costs, and otherwise&#8221;, as the Tribunal put it.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">52.	Non-cooperation, unlike obstruction or hindrance, is not a criminal offence.  In the same module in which the finding of obstruction and hindrance were made against Mr. Murphy, three other persons were found not to have co-operated, but no more.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">53.	It is to the general topic of costs which I now turn, prior to considering the propriety of the findings summarised above in the circumstances in which they are made.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Costs.</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">54.	The Murphy interests perforce, participated in the workings of the Tribunal for a total of 163 hearing days.  They were represented by solicitors and counsel and engaged in regular communication with the Tribunal and, perforce, provided the Tribunal with very significant and exhaustive discovery.  It is quite clear, and indeed obvious, that this was a remarkably expensive process which was a consequence of the decision of Dáil Éireann to establish the Tribunal, with the powers contained in the 1921 Act as amended.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Ruling on costs.</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">55.	The Ruling on the appellants&#8217; application for costs was delivered on the 9th November, 2004.  In the form in which the Tribunal delivered the ruling it was described as the &#8220;Ruling in relation to application of Joseph Murphy, Structural Engineers (JSME). Its associated Companies, Directors, Officers and Auditor&#8221;.  The ruling set out the findings in relation to the above-mentioned persons contained in the second interim report and likewise in the third interim report.  The new Chairman of the Tribunal then went on to say at pp. 6 to 7:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;The issue I have to consider is whether, having regard to the entire of the relationship between the Applicants and the Tribunal, a case can reasonably be made on behalf of the Applicants that the incidences of cooperation on the Applicants&#8217; part were such as would enable me to, for good reason, exclude or separate them from the very serious adverse findings relating to cooperation that were found by the Tribunal in both the Second and Third Interim Reports&#8230;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Applicants were between them found to have knowingly given false evidence and in the case of the late Mr. Joseph Murphy Senior, Mr. Joseph Murphy Junior, Mr. Frank Reynolds and Mr. Roger Copsey to have colluded with each other to mislead the Tribunal.  I must accept these findings and I have to assume they were properly and fairly made.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Taken as a whole the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">adverse findings of obstructing and hindering the Tribunal</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> made against the Applicants were so serious, so extensive and so far reaching as to clearly lead any reasonable person considering them to the conclusion that the individuals concerned, particularly those I have named in the preceding paragraph, were intent from the outset in ensuring that the Tribunal would not find the truth&#8230;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">To put it more simply, the conduct of the Applicants in their dealings with the Tribunal was unlawful and disreputable, and amounts to a fundamental disregard for the very purpose of the Tribunal and their legal duty to cooperate with it.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In spite of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">serious findings of corruption on the part of some of the Applicants</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">, I would have considered awarding them a portion of their costs had they chosen to fully and honestly cooperate with the Tribunal.  I am firmly of the view that there should be a strong incentive for a party to cooperate with the Tribunal and that any party who fully cooperates with the Tribunal by giving a truthful account of their knowledge of the events under inquiry can reasonably expect to recover at least a significant portion of his or her costs notwithstanding adverse findings on substantive issues such as corruption.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In all the circumstances (sic) therefore I do not believe it would be appropriate to award any costs to the Applicants and I therefore refuse their application.&#8221; (Emphasis added)</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">56.	Some of the language in this quotation reflects the fact that the findings referred to were those of the former Sole Member, Mr. Justice Flood, while the costs decision was that of the Chairman of the three judge tribunal who succeeded him.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Legality of above findings and decisions of the Tribunal.</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">57.	Article 38.1 of the Constitution provides as follows:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;No person shall be tried on any criminal charge save in due course of law.&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">58.	As we have seen above, Mr. Joseph Murphy Junior and others, have been found and declared by the Tribunal to have wilfully obstructed and hindered it in the performance of its functions.  This, by reason of the amendment to the 1921 Act which is quoted above, is a finding of a criminal offence.  But it has not been, and could not be, contended that this finding was made &#8220;in due course of law&#8221;, as that phrase is used in Article 38.1 of the Constitution.  This is not disputed.  But, it is said, that Article 38.1 applies only to trials and that the proceedings of the Tribunal do not constitute a trial or trials, and result only in the expression of opinions, which have no legal consequences.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">59.	Further, Article 34.1 of the Constitution provides that:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;Justice shall be administered in courts established by law by judges appointed in the manner provided by this Constitution, and, save in such special and limited cases as maybe prescribed by law, shall be administered in public.&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">60.	The antiquity and importance of the concepts underlying Article 38.1 of the Constitution in particular are of central importance.  In </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Conroy v. The Attorney General</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1965] IR 411, Kenny J. said at p. 415 that:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;I think that s.1 of the Article is an echo of a clause in the Great Charter of Ireland granted in 1216&#8230; [The] phrase &#8220;due process of law&#8221; was adopted by those who drafted the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America which prevents any person being deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law.  I think that s.1 of the Article gives a constitutional right to every person to be tried in accordance with the law and in accordance with due course or due process of law.&#8221;</font></ul>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">62.	In one of the cases most discussed on the hearing of this appeal, </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Goodman International v. Hamilton  </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[1992] 2 IR 542, McCarthy J. expressed similar sentiments at p.609. He said:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;In Ireland, having regard to the express provisions of Article 38, of which s.1 is an echo of the phrase &#8220;due process of law&#8221; in the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America, it may be more relevant to look to decisions of the United States Supreme Court touching on the scope and range of parliamentary investigation or inquiries.  The prescription of the Fifth Amendment, so far as relevant, is not to be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law; this may have a wider scope than the prescription of Article 38 s.1: &#8220;No  person shall be tried on any criminal charge save in due course of law&#8221;.  The rights identified at common law, such that no man be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">put to answer</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> without presentment before justices, are in my judgment subsumed by the constitutional guarantees of fundamental rights.  The prescripts of natural justice - to hear the other side and not to be a judge in one&#8217;s own cause, have, themselves, been subsumed by the constitutional right to fair procedures.  The right to be heard incorporates the right to be put to answer, to be told of the allegation, and to confront the witnesses.  History may well be a guide, but only a guide, to constitutional construction.  Rights are to be found within the constitutional framework, some created, others identified and guaranteed.&#8221; (Emphasis added)</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">63.	In this present case the Tribunal unambiguously found that certain persons had done things which, in an identical form of words, the legislature has decreed should constitute a criminal offence.  These things were not even amongst the &#8220;definite matters of urgent public importance&#8221; which the Tribunal was mandated to inquire into and report upon.  Furthermore, on the basis of that finding, or partly on that basis, the Tribunal has deprived the Murphy interests of their costs amounting (it is quite safe to assert) to a truly enormous amount of money by reason of the almost incredibly protracted nature of the Tribunal&#8217;s hearings, and the vast scope of the discovery required of them.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">64.	These facts illustrate, more clearly than any other of the very numerous cases to do with Tribunals of Inquiry which have come before the Court, the scope for conflict between a tribunal and constitutional rights especially in relation to the trial of offences.  The learned editors of Kelly on </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Irish Constitution</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> 4th Ed., (Dublin 2003) at p. 1040 state that:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;Article 38.1 is plainly referable to the trial of offences, but the novel question of whether the Oireachtas is free to establish </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">parallel procedures</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> providing for the investigation of alleged criminal (or potentially criminal) conduct was examined by the Supreme Court in Goodman International v. Hamilton, (No 1) [cited above].&#8221; (Emphasis added)</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">65.	The judgments in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Goodman</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> turn fundamentally on the distinction between the nature of a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">trial</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as opposed to that of an inquiry for the purpose merely of reporting an opinion on facts.  At a trial, according to Finlay C.J. at p.588 &#8220; the sole purpose and object of the verdict, be it one of acquittal or of conviction, is to form the basis for either a discharge of the accused from the jeopardy in which he stood, in the case of an acquittal, or for his punishment for the crime which he has committed, in the case of a conviction.&#8221;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">66.	By contrast, according to the same learned judge, &#8220;[t]he Tribunal has no jurisdiction or authority of any description to impose a penalty or punishment on any person.  Its finding can form no basis for either the conviction or acquittal of the party concerned on a criminal charge nor can it form any basis for the punishment by any other authority of that person.  It is</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> a simple fact-finding-operation, reporting to the Legislature</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">.&#8221; (Emphasis added)</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">67.	At p. 590, Finlay C.J. describes the activity of the tribunal as &#8220;to make a finding of fact, in effect, </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">in vacuo</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and to report it to the Legislature.&#8221;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">68.	The High Court judgment in</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Goodman</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> was that of Costello J. (as he then was).  He based himself to some degree on the judgment of Finlay C.J. in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Kennedy v. Herne</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1988] IR 481 at p.488  to 489 as follows:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;A characteristic of the exercise of a judicial function is that by its determination within jurisdiction the tribunal, court or individual concerned imposes liabilities or affects rights&#8221;.</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">69.	He goes on to consider the Tribunal in question in the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Goodman </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">litigation, the Beef Tribunal, and said at p.556 to 557 that &#8220;in inquiring into these allegations and in reporting its opinion on them the Tribunal is not imposing any liabilities or affecting any rights&#8230; It may come to the conclusion that some or all the allegations of wrongdoing are true, but this opinion is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">devoid of legal consequences</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">.&#8221; (Emphasis added)</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">70.	Costello J. then went on to discuss a number of New Zealand, Australian and American cases to which he had been referred and in particular the well known Australian case of </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Victoria v. Australian Building Construction Employees Federation</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (1982) 152 C.L.R. 25.  He quoted in particular from the judgment of Brennan J. at pp. 152 to 153 which contains a phrase which has subsequently been used throughout the common law world in relation to the findings of Tribunals or Commissions of Inquiry.  The quotation is to be found at p.562 of the judgment of Costello J. in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Goodman</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;What the common law and the early statutes forbade to the executive was the assumption of any judicial function or interference with the judicial process.  A commission of mere inquiry and report - affecting no rights privileges or immunities, imposing no liabilities, exposing to no legal disadvantage - cannot be (unless the circumstances are exceptional) either an authority for the assumption of judicial function or an interference with the judicial process.  Even if a commissioner be directed to inquire into and report upon a contravention of the law, the inquiry and report are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sterile of legal effect.  </font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is not the nature of the facts to be found, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">but the legal effect of the finding which may stamp an inquiry as judicial</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">.  The absence of any legal effect in the findings of a royal commissioner appointed merely to enquire and report denies any suggestion that such a commissioner is exercising judicial power.&#8221; </font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	(Emphasis added)</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">71.	The phrase referred to above is &#8220;sterile of legal effect&#8221; or &#8220;legally sterile&#8221; as it is sometime rendered, used as a description of the quality of a tribunal which prevents it from being an unconstitutional usurpation of judicial functions and powers.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">72.	The significance of the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Goodman</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> decision for this branch of the law can hardly be overstated.  Nor, if I may say so, could the case against the compatibility of the system of Tribunals of Inquiry, within our constitutional dispensation, be more convincingly put than in the submission of Mr. Seamus McKenna S.C. and Donal O&#8217;Donnell for Laurence Goodman, set out at pp. 572 to 573.  Mr. McKenna said:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;The issue of the right of the Tribunal to investigate the truth or otherwise of allegations of criminal conduct or illegal activities, or fraud, is the core and fundamental constitutional question in this case.&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">73.	He went on to contend, in a passage of remarkable force, that if the powers of the Tribunal of Inquiry were upheld that it would, therefore, be open to the members of the legislature or some of them to constitute themselves as a parallel court to investigate allegations, with the sole reservation that </font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;[w]e cannot punish you by way of imprisonment but we may order you to pay what might in some circumstances be an enormous penalty by way of costs in relation to one or other of the parties before us.&#8221; </font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">74.	It was this forceful proposition, it seems to me, that led to the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">dictum</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of McCarthy J. on costs, discussed below.  This fact, also, seems strongly to indicate that the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">dictum</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of McCarthy J. is not, as the Respondents at one point submitted, merely </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">obiter</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">75.	Nevertheless, the courts upheld the constitutionality of the Tribunal of Inquiry known as the Beef Tribunal </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">on the basis that what it did was not the trial of an offence</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">.  It is worth recapitulating some of the characteristics attributed by the judgments in this Court and the High Court to the tribunal findings, which prevented their being the trial of an offence.  The phrases now to be considered were, accordingly, the Court&#8217;s expression of the aspects of the legal nature of a Tribunal of Inquiry which prevents it offending the Constitution.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">76.	In the words of Costello J., or in the words of the judicial authorities cited with approval by him, the Tribunal of Inquiry is &#8220;not imposing any liabilities or affecting any rights&#8221; (at p.557); its conclusions have merely the status of opinion and &#8220;this opinion is devoid of legal consequences&#8221; (at p.557), its findings are &#8220;sterile of legal effect&#8221; (562 and its purpose is &#8220;merely&#8221; to inquire and report (at p.562).  A Tribunal of Inquiry is &#8220;a simple fact-finding-operation&#8221; according to Finlay C.J. (at p.588).  The Tribunal has no power to inflict a penalty and its determinations cannot &#8220;form any basis for the punishment by any other authority of that person&#8221; at p.588. Its function is to &#8220;make a finding of fact, in effect, </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">in vacuo</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, and to report it to the Legislature.&#8221; (at p.590)</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">77.	This judgment will shortly address the question of whether the present Tribunal of Inquiry, in acting as it has done, and as is summarised earlier in this judgment, exhibits those characteristics of a Tribunal of Inquiry which alone protect it from constitutional vulnerability.  First, however, it is appropriate to consider some further aspects of </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Goodman</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, and certain </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">dicta</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> from the judgment of McCarthy J. on the specific topic of costs.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">78.	</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Goodman</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is a decision of this Court, a case of high authority which we have not been asked to disapprove and which I propose to follow.  It is true that Mr. Michael Collins S.C. who appeared for the Tribunal on this appeal said he would ask the Court &#8220;if necessary&#8221; to depart from </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Goodman</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">.  I take it however, that this is a reference solely to the dictum of McCarthy J. to be discussed below and not to the principal thrust of </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Goodman</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, which has been for almost twenty years every Tribunal of Inquiry&#8217;s title to constitutionality.  No argument was directed against any finding in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Goodman</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> except the dictum of McCarthy J. Nevertheless, it must be acknowledged that, in distinguishing the findings of a tribunal from the verdict of a court, the judges were obliged to make some rather subtle distinctions which one may take leave to doubt would count for much in the minds of ordinary people. I have to some extent explored this topic in my judgment in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Maguire v. Ardagh</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2002] 1 I.R. 385 at 669.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">79.	Hederman J., in his judgment in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Goodman</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> cited extensively from the dissenting judgment of Murphy J. in the Australian case cited above.  The citation can be found at pp. 599 to 600 of the judgment and I propose to quote simply the first three sentences:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;The authority given to the Commissioner to exercise such an important ingredient of judicial power as finding a person guilty of ordinary crimes, is in itself an undermining of the separation of powers.  It is a fine point to answer that the finding is not binding and does not of itself make the person liable to punitive consequences.  It is by fine points such as this that human freedom is whittled away.&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">80.	I believe that points such as these and the others made by Murphy J. and quoted by Hederman J. must always be borne in mind in this area of the law.  I would also observe that the considerations there expressed in my opinion apply whether (in the memorable phrase of Mr. McKenna S.C. at p. 573) the &#8220;Tribunal of inquiry [is] presided over by a Solomon or a simpleton.&#8221;  The confining of a Tribunal of Inquiry within its proper bounds in no way reflects on the individuals who compose it.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Costs Provisions.</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">81.	Section 6 of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act 1979 provided as follows, at the time when Goodman was decided:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">6(1) Where a tribunal, or if the tribunal consists of more than one member, the chairman of the tribunal, is of opinion that, having regard to the findings of the tribunal and all other relevant matters, there are sufficient reasons rendering it equitable to do, the tribunal or the chairman, as the case may be, may by order direct that the whole or part of the costs of any person appearing before the tribunal by counsel or solicitor, as taxed by a Taxing Master of the High Court, shall be paid to the person by any other person named in the order. </font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">82.	In his judgment in</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Goodman</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, McCarthy J. briefly expressed his agreement that (at p.604) that &#8220;[t]here is no usurpation of the role of the judiciary in the administration of justice&#8221; for the reasons given by the other judges and summarised above.  He devoted the bulk of his judgment to the question of fair procedures before a tribunal, saying at p.605:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;No challenge was made to the constitutional validity of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act 1979, but it must be construed as subject to the constitutional framework and, in particular, involving fair procedures.&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">83.	The learned judge then went on to expound the requirements of fair procedures under a number of headings of which the third related to s.6 of the 1979 Act, the source of the jurisdiction to award costs. McCarthy J. said at p. 605:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;The liability to pay costs cannot depend upon the findings of the Tribunal as to the subject matter of the inquiry. When the inquiry is in respect of a single disaster, then, ordinarily, any party permitted to be represented at the inquiry should have their costs paid out of public funds.  The whole or part of those costs may be disallowed by the Tribunal because of the conduct of or on behalf of that party at, during or in connection with the inquiry.  The expression &#8220;the findings of the tribunal&#8221; should be read as the findings as to the conduct of the parties at the tribunal. In all other cases the allowance of costs at public expense lies within the discretion of the Tribunal or, where appropriate, its chairman.&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">84.	The Tribunal in question here is, of course, not concerned to inquire into a single disaster (as for example the Whiddy or Stardust Tribunals were).  It seems to me that the principle behind the passage just cited in the judgment of McCarthy J. is this: a Tribunal of Inquiry will be convened only when some thing or things have happened which have given rise to grave public disquiet.  Pursuant to the 1921 Act such a tribunal may be convened only in relation to &#8220;a definite matter of urgent public importance&#8221;, and only where it is &#8220;expedient&#8221; in the public interest that a tribunal be established.  Thus, a tribunal to which the 1921 Act applies may be established only in the public interest and in acute circumstances which, for the satisfaction of the public, require elucidation.  Historically, tribunals have often been established in the aftermath of a single disaster occurring due to negligence, act of God or in unknown circumstances.  But, equally, many tribunals have been established in relation to matters which derived their significance from commercial, financial or political concerns, and which also require elucidation in the public interest.  The former class of inquiry may easily involve persons who are completely innocent of any involvement in the cause of the disaster but whose evidence is still required to be taken.  See the report of the Whiddy Tribunal.  It is reasonable that, since their presence and their evidence is required in the public interest, the public purse should defray the costs of and incidental to such evidence. In the latter sort of inquiry the people whose attendance and evidence is required are more likely to have some prior involvement, innocent or otherwise, in the chain of events leading to the establishment of the tribunal.  Nevertheless the supreme importance, in the public interest, of having all their evidence available means that they cannot be penalised in costs for their past behaviour relating to the substantive subject matter of the tribunal&#8217;s inquiries.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">85.	The significance of the circumstances in which costs may be awarded is of course very great in practice.  Due to the very prolonged nature of the Tribunal sittings, it has been openly speculated that the total costs of the Tribunal and all other parties will run into tens of millions of euros.  To be made to pay even a small fraction of such costs is plainly a very significant matter, perhaps financially ruinous for an individual or a company.  It is very difficult to regard a conclusion of a tribunal which may determine, or influence, so significant a liability as being one which &#8220;does not impose liabilities or affect rights&#8221; or one which merely has the status of opinion and &#8220;this opinion is devoid of legal consequences&#8221; or &#8220;sterile of legal effect&#8221; or as a finding made &#8220;in effect, </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">in vacuo</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221;. Still less is it &#8220;devoid of legal consequences&#8221;.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">86.	Yet it was only by so characterising the conclusions of a Tribunal that its constitutionality was preserved in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Goodman</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">.  It appears to me that McCarthy J. was conscious of the very acute difficulty for the analysis presented in the judgments of Costello J. and Finlay C.J. (and with which he agreed) of the costs jurisdiction (which emphatically imposes liabilities) that he wrote as he did in the passage cited above.  I may say that the difficulty is not rendered less acute by the terms of the amending Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act 1997, nor of the Terms of Reference of this Tribunal, which will be discussed below.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">87.	The Tribunal, in its submissions, has fully recognised the great significance of the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">dictum</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of McCarthy J. cited above.  It has sought to address it in three ways: firstly that it is simply the judgment of a single judge; secondly that it is any event </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">obiter</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and thirdly that it has been overtaken by subsequent legislation, in particular the 1997 Act.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">88.	In </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Goodman</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> there were three judgments in the Supreme Court, those of Chief Justice Finlay and Hederman and McCarthy JJ.  The other judges, O&#8217;Flaherty and Egan JJ expressly agreed with each of the judgments delivered.  Moreover, Finlay C.J. expressly agreed with Mr. Justice McCarthy&#8217;s</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> dicta</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> on the subject of costs.  At p.591 to 592of the judgment the former Chief Justice stated:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;With regard to the questions of the common law precedents concerning commissions of inquiries in other common law countries, and with regard to other questions raised concerning the construction of ss. 4, 5, and 6 of the Act of 1979, I have had the opportunity of reading the judgment which is about to be delivered by McCarthy J., and I agree with it.&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">89.	It does not, therefore, seem possible plausibly to argue that the judgment of McCarthy J. expresses simply his own view: it appears to have the endorsement quite expressly of at least three of his colleagues. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">90.	As I have noted above, McCarthy J. agreed that &#8220;there is no usurpation of the role of the judiciary in the administration of justice&#8221; in the establishment of a tribunal such as that then under consideration.  He did this for the reasons given by his colleagues and summarised earlier in this judgment.  But this was based on his presumption that the requirements of fair procedures would be observed by any tribunal sitting pursuant to the 1979 Act which statute &#8220;&#8230; must be construed as subject to the constitutional framework and, in particular, involving fair procedures&#8221;. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">91.	I would remark with respect that this latter observation is manifestly correct.  This fact is inconsistent with the observation of McCarthy J. being merely </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">obiter</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">.  Indeed, on the contrary, the passage in question seems to me to turn upon the construction of the arguably general phrase &#8220;the findings of the Tribunal&#8221; in a particular, limited, way so as to avoid the constitutional vulnerability which would follow if those words in the 1979 Act were given an entirely literal meaning.  This, of course, involves the assumption that these words are capable of a different and narrower meaning, which, like McCarthy J., I believe they are.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">92.	The question of the effect of subsequent legislation will be considered below.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The decision on Costs.</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">93.	Against that background, it is now necessary to consider the basis on which the Murphy interests were refused their costs. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">94.	It will be recalled, and is in any event set out above, that the then Chairman of the Tribunal held that:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Taken as a whole the adverse findings of obstructing obstructing and hindering</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the Tribunal made against the Applicants&#8217; were so serious, so extensive and so far reaching as to clearly lead any reasonable person considering them to the conclusion that the individuals concerned, particularly those I have named in the preceding paragraph, were intent from the outset in ensuring that the Tribunal would not find the truth...</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In spite of the serious findings of corruption on the part of some of the Applicants&#8217; I would have considered awarding them a portion of their costs had they chosen to fully and honestly cooperate with the Tribunal. I am firmly of the view that there should be a strong incentive for a party to cooperate with the Tribunal and that any party who fully cooperates with the Tribunal by giving a truthful account of their knowledge of the events under inquiry can reasonably expect to recover at least a significant portion of his or her costs notwithstanding adverse findings on substantive issues such as corruption.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In all the circumstances therefore I do not believe it would be appropriate to award any costs to the Applicants and I therefore refuse their application.&#8221; (Emphasis added)</font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">95.	From this ruling the following propositions seems to me to follow:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">(a) That, in the Tribunal&#8217;s mind, the appellants had disentitled themselves to some portion of their costs by virtue of the &#8220;serious findings of corruption&#8221; i.e. findings on the subject matter of the inquiry. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(b) But they might still have recovered &#8220;a portion of their costs&#8221; had they, in the Tribunal&#8217;s view, co-operated with it.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(c) These &#8220;portions&#8221; are not defined in terms of fractions or percentages but it is said that a person who co-operates fully and truthfully with a tribunal can reasonably expect to recover at least &#8220;a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">significant</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> portion of his or her costs&#8221;, notwithstanding adverse substantive findings. (Emphasis added)</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(d) Therefore, both the substantive findings and the &#8220;obstructing and hindering&#8221; finding are implicated in the tribunal&#8217;s decision refusing </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all </font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">costs.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(e) It is quite clear from the full text of costs ruling, which is referred to earlier in this judgment, that the substantive findings, like the finding of obstruction and hindrance, contributed to the decision to refuse costs to the appellants. This appears quite contrary to the dictum of McCarthy J., cited above from </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Goodman</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">.</font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">96.	In making submissions on the costs ruling, counsel for the Tribunal on the hearing of this appeal had some difficulty in construing it.  However, he confirmed that the phrase, in the Tribunal&#8217;s list of the ways in which the Tribunal had allegedly been hindered and obstructed by Mr. Murphy, &#8220;failing to give a truthful account&#8221; means perjury.  He also confirmed that those findings reflect the fact that &#8220;</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">every</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> conflict of fact had been resolved against the Applicants&#8221;. (Emphasis added)  But he first agreed that both the findings of corruption and the findings of non-cooperation &#8220;are implicated as the basis of the costs order&#8221;.  However, he almost immediately amended this saying &#8220;no, the finding of corruption is not at all involved.&#8221;  I do not understand the logic of this, or how it relates to the express words of the ruling, which clearly states, in its penultimate paragraph, that the &#8220;serious findings of corruption&#8221; have reduced the costs entitlements even of a co-operating party to a &#8220;portion&#8221; or a &#8220;significant portion&#8221; of his total costs.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">97.	In the ruling, the Tribunal considered </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">both</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the substantive findings as to the subject matter of the Tribunal&#8217;s inquiries </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">and</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the Tribunal&#8217;s conclusions as to the degree of co-operation it has received from a party are relevant to the award of costs.  But they are relevant to different (though undefined) portions of the costs.  An undefined but &#8220;significant&#8221; portion of the costs is referable to conduct before the Tribunal alone, without regard to any adverse substantive findings.  In the circumstances of this case the appellants failed to meet the Tribunal&#8217;s criteria either in relation to the substantive subject of its inquiries or in relation to their conduct before the Tribunal.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">98.	The extent to which this is consistent with the statutory power set out at s.6 of the 1979 Act as amended and the authorities cited above, specifically the judgment of McCarthy J. cited above, will soon fall to be considered. </font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Undisclosed material.</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">99.	But there is another and separate aspect of the Tribunal&#8217;s proceeding about which the appellants complain.  They say that they have discovered very late in the day, in the course of discovery made by the Tribunal a very short time before the High Court hearing of this case, that the Tribunal had in its possession for a number of years, certain tape recorded and transcribed material.  This appears to show their accuser, Mr. Gogarty, making allegations of impropriety, some extremely grave, against other, unconnected, persons.  They say that this material was manifestly relevant to the question of Mr. Gogarty&#8217;s credibility and that it was quite wrongly not disclosed to them.  This had the effect of concealing it from them.  Instead, they were given a &#8220;redacted&#8221; version of the material in question, from which the Sole Member had excised all references to the allegations made by, or attributed to, Mr. Gogarty against these third parties.  They say that the Tribunal, precisely as was done in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">O&#8217;Callaghan v. Mahon</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2006] 2 IR 32, wrongfully concealed this material from them.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Nature of the materials.</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">100.	As mentioned above the material in question was eventually produced only long after the appellants had issued these judicial review proceedings and the plenary proceedings with which they were consolidated.  The Court was told without contradiction that the material was produced not more than a fortnight before the hearing of the High Court proceedings.  The Murphy interests had no prior access to them and were refused such access when they asked for all redacted material.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">101.	The discovered material showed that Mr. Gogarty had apparently made statements to the Tribunal or to third parties alleging serious improprieties against at least four other persons whom it is fair to describe as being well known persons of good reputation.  One of these persons has since died.  The first and most immediately relevant of the allegations was that Mr. Gogarty claimed to know, from a named source, that money was paid in cash, not only to Mr. Burke, but to another politician, in connection with a named site, and that the two politicians had co-operated to bring about a desired result.  I do not propose to mention the name of the other politician, or the site, or the timing of this event but its relevance to the matters at issue before the Tribunal is obvious.  Either Mr. Gogarty was telling the truth when he said that the named person gave him this information, or he was not.  Either the information itself was true, or it was not.  If either of these matters was untrue, that would involve the consequence that Mr. Gogarty had made an admittedly or demonstrably false allegation against another prominent politician.  This in turn would have been gravely destructive of his credibility and would raise questions as to his motivation.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">102.	None of the other persons against whom Mr. Gogary is portrayed as making or relating allegations are as prominent as the second politician whose alleged activities have just been described. But it is fair to say, at the same time, that they are all well known persons in professional commercial and political circles. It would be difficult to give a flavour of what was said about them without tending to identify them: in any event, the allegation about the second politician, because it also involves a person already much mentioned before the Tribunal (Mr. Burke) and because of its general similarity to the &#8220;Briarsgate&#8221; allegation, where findings adverse to the Appellants were made, is the most glaring omission. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">103.	On the hearing of this appeal the Tribunal&#8217;s counsel dealt with this matter very briefly indeed, saying only that the appellant should have had the material but they had not been given it.  I interpret this as acquiescence in the factual aspect of the appellants&#8217; complaints but putting in issue the legal significance of them.  He said the Tribunal had acted wrongly, but in good faith and for the avoidance of collateral issues.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">104.	At this point it is necessary to repeat, as has already been said several times in this judgment, that the appellants&#8217; claims for relief relate wholly to the findings of obstruction and hindrance and do not extend to the substantive findings of the Tribunal on the issues into which it was set up to inquire.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">105.	This issue of concealed material comes before the Courts very late indeed.  The appellants cannot be blamed for this since they received the material only, it would appear, a matter of days before the High Court hearing.  One of the consequences of this delay is that, unfortunately, both Mr. Gogarty and at least one of the persons against whom he appears to have made allegations have died since the eventual disclosure.  Mr. Gogarty&#8217;s death means that the material in question can never now be deployed in cross-examination of him and he himself is, of course, unable to defend his position.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         106.	The rights of third parties make it difficult to give any satisfactory account in this judgment of the material in question.  However it is possible to say that, at least on one tenable view of it, it is material of an explosive nature, given the position and significance of Mr. Gogarty to the Tribunal&#8217;s findings.  But in dealing with the material here it is necessary for the Court to have regard to the good name of the persons against whom he is said to have made allegations, who were and are without exception prominent and reputable people.  It is important to say that, having read the papers presented for the purpose of this appeal, I have absolutely no reason to believe that the allegations said to have been made against the third parties have any truth whatever to them.  Indeed, having regard to their constitutional right to their good name and the obligations which that imposes on the State, including the courts, I intend to presume that the allegations made against them are false.  But that, as will be seen, merely emphasises the importance of the material from the appellants&#8217; point of view.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Position of Mr. Gogarty</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">107.	Mr. Gogarty was the principal, and on many matters the only, witness against the Murphy interests.  For example, the allegations against Mr. Joseph Murphy Senior and Mr. Joseph Murphy Junior in relation to the alleged payment to Mr. Burke, depend wholly on his evidence.  All of the other relevant witnesses contradicted him.  There was no question of corroboration or other external support for the account he gave, insofar as it concerns the Murphy interests. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">108.	Accordingly, the appellant&#8217;s have been gravely damaged in their characters and reputation and face an enormous financial liability, wholly on the basis of an issue of credibility between Mr. Gogarty and themselves.  If the allegations which Mr. Gogarty was making were to be tested at all, their defence to them had to raise the question of Mr. Gogarty&#8217;s credibility.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">109.	Every lawyer with even a little experience is aware of the exigencies of a hearing of that sort.  The law and the procedures adopted  must give ample scope to a person accused to defend himself according to the needs of the individual case.  In </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Re Haughey</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1971] IR 217 at 264 Chief Justice Ó Dálaigh said:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;[I]n proceedings before any tribunal where a party to the proceedings is on risk of having his good name, or his person or property or any of his personal rights jeopardised, the proceedings may be correctly classed as proceedings which may affect his rights, and in compliance with the Constitution the State, either by its enactments or through the Courts, must outlaw any procedures which will restrict or prevent the party concerned from vindicating these rights.&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">110.	On that basis the Court held that a person in the position mentioned in the preceding paragraph is in all cases entitled to the following &#8220;minimum protection&#8221;:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;(a) that he should be furnished with a copy of the evidence which reflected on his good name;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(b) that he should be allowed to cross-examine, by counsel, his accuser or accusers;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(c) that he should be allowed to give rebutting evidence and </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(d) that he should be permitted to address, again by counsel, the Committee in his own defence.&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">111.	The </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Haughey</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> case was decided in the context of an inquiry by the Oireachtas Committee on Public Accounts.  But Ó Dálaigh C.J. continued, at p.264, to say that without the rights mentioned above:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;[No] accused - I speak within the context of the terms of the inquiry - could hope to make any adequate defence of his good name.  To deny such rights is, an ancestral adage, a classic case of </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">clocha ceangailte agus madraí scoilte</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">.  Article 40, s.3 of the Constitution is a guarantee to the citizen of basic fairness of procedures.  The Constitution guarantees such fairness and it is the duty of the Court to underline that the words of Article 40,s.3 are not political shibboleths but provide a positive protection for the citizen and his good name.&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">112.	It will be apparent from the foregoing that one of the principal recourses of a citizen who is attacked, undermined in his character and reputation and who faces the possibility of an enormous liability on the basis (here) of the uncorroborated evidence of a single witness, is to cross-examine such person or have him cross-examined on the accused person&#8217;s behalf.  The great importance of cross-examination has already been the subject of discussion by me in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Maguire v. Ardagh</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2002] 1 IR 385, at p.704. I do not want to lengthen this judgment by recapitulating this material, but I wish to be taken as restating as what is said there at pp 704 to 707, particularly the observation (at p. 707) that cross-examination &#8220;has been the means of the vindication of innocent people&#8221;.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">113.	In the course of this passage I also said at p. 705:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;Cross-examination is a special skill and usually an acquired one, of which a thorough knowledge of the facts of a particular case is merely the foundation.&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">114.	Here, the Tribunal does not dispute that the appellants were entitled, before being found guilty of obstruction or hindrance, to fair procedures and specifically to the rights enunciated in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Haughey</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">.  These rights include, prominently, a right to cross-examination.  Oral contradiction in a public forum is the culmination of the work of the cross-examiner but is by no means the whole of it.  All effective cross-examinations (especially in matters as wide ranging, and as old, as those on the basis of which a finding of obstruction and hindrance were made here), are the result of intensive preparation.  Such preparation involves an extremely thorough consideration of what precisely the witness is saying, what the scope to contradict him from other sources is, and whether the witness&#8217;s own credibility is vulnerable to attack.  It would be positively negligent of any professional cross-examiner to fail to consider what he or she might hope to achieve under each of these headings.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Procedures of the Tribunal.</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">115.	There was a time when the whole, or substantially the whole, of the work of a Tribunal of Inquiry would take place in public.  Though this may have had some disadvantages, and may have prolonged the sittings (though to nothing like the extent which has since become common) it had the advantage that all parties who had been granted representation knew precisely what material the tribunal and its lawyers had.  But this custom has changed, to the point where certain modern Tribunals of Inquiry can go for periods of months or even years without holding a public sitting as they are conducting certain inquiries in private.  Though this may have some advantages, it has the drawback that (apart from leaks) only the tribunal knows precisely what material has been gathered.  In the case cited several times above, </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">O&#8217;Callaghan v. Mahon</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, a complaint was made that though the tribunal had a good deal of material highly relevant to the credibility of a witness making extremely damaging allegations against Mr. O&#8217;Callaghan, this had not been disclosed to him or to solicitors or counsel acting for him.  In that case, the nub of the complaint made when the material eventually came to Mr. O&#8217;Callaghan&#8217;s knowledge was that his accuser had apparently given different accounts of important and relevant events at different times.  He also complained that there had been a consistent practice of redacting, i.e. excising, exclusively material damaging to his accuser&#8217;s credibility.  This is a feature of the present case as well.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">116.	Mr. O&#8217;Callaghan issued proceedings by way of judicial review claiming that he was entitled to see all statements that his accuser had given to the tribunal and sought a declaration that the refusal to disclose such statements amounted to a breach of fair procedures.  The tribunal resisted this and argued that the Court should not interfere with what they did because they were &#8220;masters of their own procedure&#8221;.  Mr. O&#8217;Callaghan was successful both in the High Court and, on the tribunal&#8217;s appeal, in this Court.  It was emphasised in particular that, in the context of a tribunal which conducts extensive inquiries in private, the right to cross-examine is not vindicated simply by giving counsel for the party attacked an opportunity to stand up and ask the witness some questions: on the contrary, he or she must be given any material within the knowledge of the tribunal which has the reasonable possibility of being useful in cross-examination, simply because the material exists and is not known to the parties accused since the tribunal has kept it confidential.  In the words of Geoghegan J. at p. 81:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220; it was absolutely essential that the documents and materials which were sought for the purpose of carrying out a worthwhile cross-examination in the extraordinary circumstances where wild allegations were flying around the tribunal against the applicant and of which he had no prior notice, be duly produced.&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">117.	This case is not precisely the same as the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">O&#8217;Callaghan </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">case.  Because of the need to consider the reputation of the people involved, presumptively innocent people of good repute, only a very restricted account of the materials now to hand here can be given.  But there is no doubt, and it has not been denied, that solicitors and counsel for the Murphy interests sought copies of all statements by Mr. Gogarty made to the Tribunal, or to third parties but which were in the possession of the Tribunal.  They were refused this.  They were told expressly on several occasions in writing that the then Sole Member (and not the present chairman of the Tribunal) had personally decided that the materials which had been redacted were &#8220;irrelevant&#8221;.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">118.	An examination of the correspondence which the Tribunal had with the appellants&#8217; solicitors shows that &#8220;any deletions in the transcripts have been certified by the Sole Member as wholly irrelevant.&#8221;  The Sole Member himself remarked, in the transcript of the 8th July, 1999:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;That&#8217;s correct.  I listened to the tapes.  I had a transcript of the entirety of the verbal or the oral statements or whatever it is, evidence on the tapes.  I listened to them, sorry I had a transcript, I listened to the actual tape, I had a red pencil and I blocked out pieces which I thought were of absolutely no relevance to [named person] or this Tribunal.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It would, I suppose, be pejorative to say that the tapes in part followed a certain gentleman&#8217;s capacity. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I cleaned, not the tapes, I cleaned the script, and I believe that I have done a reasonably fair job, I certainly didn&#8217;t cull anything that I thought could be of interest to any party in the Tribunal.  Now that&#8217;s what you have got because there were other people mentioned, there was this, that and the other mentioned and&#8230;&#8221;.</font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">119.	Counsel for the Murphy interests, Mr. Cush, then suggested that the redacted material be disclosed simply to one member of the appellants&#8217; legal team so that he could form a view on its utility and use it where appropriate, but this request was denied.  It must have been perfectly clear that this decision stymied cross-examination.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">120.	I have to say that I simply do not understand the basis on which (to take the simplest example) the allegation made about the other politician was redacted.  If the ordinary discovery rules applied, as expounded in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">O&#8217;Callaghan v. Mahon</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, then anything capable of supporting the appellants case or undermining that of their accuser should have been produced.  The question of the allegation against the other politician was manifestly relevant as to the credibility both of  Mr. Gogarty as to his saying it, as to whether it had in fact come from the source he alleged, and as to whether or not it was true.  Moreover, it would appear to be an allegation itself actually within the Tribunal&#8217;s remit: it is not obvious why it was not disclosed on that basis.  Moreover, it was actually linked to Mr. Burke who was of course the subject of intensive investigations. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">121.	On the hearing of this appeal, counsel for the Tribunal (who had not been involved as one of the counsel appearing for the Tribunal at its own sittings) said that he did not stand over the redaction and non-production of the material in question.  He said that &#8220;Bearing in mind the decision of this Court in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">O&#8217;Callaghan</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, I am conceding that the document should have been given to the Appellants.&#8217;&#8217;  By way of explanation he said that Judge Mahon (presumably an error for Mr. Justice Flood) thought that the documents in question were not relevant but in any event he said that the documents were irrelevant to the judicial review proceedings, even though it was in these proceedings that the documents were eventually disclosed.  He then referred to the Tribunal&#8217;s &#8220;need to limit collateral credibility issues: they redacted the documents.&#8221;  It is not entirely clear to me how the last matters fit in with the concession recorded above.  And the allegation about the second politician, at least, is not a &#8220;collateral&#8221; issue on any view.  It was concealed without justification.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">122.	It is noteworthy that before the Tribunal, in July, 1999, one of the Tribunal counsel (Mr. Gallagher S.C.) appeared to rely on confidentiality as a reason for non-disclosure.  He said:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;[A named person who had apparently given tapes and transcripts of Mr. Gogarty to the Tribunal] agreed to furnish the material to the Tribunal for the assistance of the Tribunal on the very strict understanding that it would only have been available to the Tribunal and only relevant matters material and relevant to the Tribunal would be circulated.&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">123.	In other words, the named person, who was a journalist, gave tapes and transcripts of his conversation to Mr. Gogarty and notes of them to the Tribunal but required a certain confidentiality which, in the Tribunal Counsels view, prevented their disclosure to the parties Mr. Gogarty was accusing.  It is noteworthy that this defence or explanation of non-disclosure was not offered on the hearing of the appeal and appears wholly unstateable, particularly if reference is made to the judgment of Geoghegan J. in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">O&#8217;Callaghan v. Mahon</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, where a plea of confidentiality was advanced as a basis for non-disclosure.  A witness cannot dictate how a court or tribunal will treat his evidence, or any items he produces.  The interests of justice are paramount.  It is also disturbing that the refusal of Mr. Cush&#8217;s request for the undisclosed material was made after the High Court decision in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">O&#8217;Callaghan v. Mahon</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">.  Accordingly, it could only be justified on the basis that the Tribunal might have succeeded in its appeal to this Court.  But when its appeal was unsuccessful, the decision was not reviewed.  I find this very disturbing.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Statutory changes.</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">124.	The present wording of s.6 of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act, 1979, after its amendment by s.3 of the identically titled 1997Act is as follows:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;(1) Where a tribunal or, if the tribunal consists of more than one member, the chairperson of the tribunal, is of opinion that, having regard to the findings of the tribunal and all other relevant matters (including the terms of the resolution passed by each House of the Oireachtas relating to the establishment of the tribunal or failing to co-operate with or provide assistance to, or knowingly giving false or misleading information to the tribunal), there are sufficient reasons rendering it equitable to do so, the tribunal, or the chairperson, as the case may be, may, either of the tribunal's or the chairperson's own motion, as the case may be, or on application by any person appearing before the tribunal, order that the whole or part of the costs&#8212;</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">(a) of any person appearing before the tribunal by counsel or solicitor, as taxed by a Taxing Master of the High Court, shall be paid to the person by any other person named in the order.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(b) incurred by the Tribunal, as taxed as aforesaid, shall be paid to the Minister for Finance by any other person named in the order&#8221;.</font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">125.	The resolution establishing the present Tribunal, as passed in Dáil Éireann on the 7th October, 1997 contains the following paragraph in relation to costs:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">(C) (a)	- </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(b) all costs incurred by reason of the failure of individuals to cooperate fully and expeditiously with the Inquiry should, so far as is consistent with the interests of justice, be borne by those individuals.&#8221;</font></ul>
<br>
</ul>
</ul>
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Vires.</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">126.	It will be observed that neither the statute, nor the resolution of Dáil Éireann, request or require the Tribunal to investigate questions of &#8220;obstruction and hindrance&#8221;.  This is critical.  It is simply not part of the Tribunal&#8217;s remit.  Insofar as the question of costs are concerned, it would have been quite possible to make a finding, if the Tribunal considered the evidence supported it, that there had been a lack of cooperation on the part of any named parties.  This is what was done in the case of other parties.  Instead, the Tribunal appears, on the basis of the evidence set out above, quite consciously and deliberately to have used the words &#8220;obstruct and hinder&#8221; in the full knowledge that this was the identical phrase used to constitute one of the criminal offences capable of being committed in relation to the Tribunal. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">127.	Equally, the wording of s.6 of the 1979 Act, as inserted by the 1997Act, speaks (in the context of costs), of a &#8220;failing to co-operate&#8221;.  It is not obvious why the Tribunal felt impelled to go further than this when their only concern with the conduct of the parties (as opposed to their actions in the substantive matter under inquiry) was in relation to costs.  This Tribunal&#8217;s course of action is also at variance with that of the McCracken Tribunal, which also sent the papers in relation to how a particular person had interacted with the tribunal to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  That tribunal, in taking the step, made no finding in relation to obstruction or hindrance but rather left the Director of Public Prosecutions to make up his mind whether or not to prosecute without any unnecessary Tribunal finding in relation to a criminal offence. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">128.	I do not believe that the expression by Dáil Éireann of the desire, in relation to costs, expressed at para (C), sub-paragraph (b) of the Resolution of the 7th October, 1997, in any way authorises or entitles the tribunal to make findings of the commission of a criminal offence other than findings which relate to the &#8220;definite matters of urgent public importance&#8221; set out at para. (A) of the Resolution of the 7th October, 1997.  Insofar as it might be argued that the statutory provisions quoted above, from the Acts of 1979 and 1997 in relation to costs or sub-paragraph (b) of paragraph (C) of the Resolution imply such a power, I would decline to accept this.  The statutes and Resolutions are expressed quite otherwise insofar as &#8220;obstruction and hindrance&#8221; are concerned and do not require a finding that these things have in fact occurred for the exercise of any legitimate discretion the Tribunal has in relation to costs.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">129.	For the reasons set out earlier in this judgment, I believe that the dictum of McCarthy J. cited above from the case of </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Goodman v. Hamilton</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> continues to represent the law.  For the reasons set out above I am wholly unimpressed by the tripartite challenge to it: on the contrary, I believe that McCarthy J. was conscious of a possible weakness in this Court&#8217;s and the High Court&#8217;s approach to the constitutionality of the tribunal, in the form of an argument that the costs jurisdiction prevented its substantive findings being &#8220;devoid of legal effect&#8221;.  He found as he did in a necessary attempt to attribute to a tribunal under the 1921 Act as amended procedures which were themselves both fair and constitutional.  If his judgment were to be attacked, it might more easily be done, in my opinion, on the basis that it is scarcely possible to regard the present costs jurisdiction (created in part many years after the judgment of McCarthy J.) as meaning that the tribunal&#8217;s findings are &#8220;devoid of legal effect.&#8221;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">130.	On the basis of </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Goodman v. Hamilton</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, the order refusing costs in this case must fall since, apart from anything else, it is plainly based in part on the substantive findings of the tribunal.  It is not possible to sever this order because the tribunal itself has not made it clear to what portion of the costs the findings on the substantive issues refer.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">131.	I am also of the view that the appellants&#8217; complaints to the effect that they were not put on notice that the Tribunal was considering making the finding of obstruction and hindrance, and that this was not communicated to them even when their solicitors specifically raised in correspondence the topic of the matters required to be addressed in the costs phase are borne out.  Indeed, this is not disputed.  Such notice was manifestly necessary, especially in light of the significance the tribunal placed on this finding in refusing costs.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">132.	I agree with the judgment of Fennelly J. in relation to the defence based on an alleged delay on the part of the applicants and I would reject the tribunal&#8217;s contentions in this regard, for the reasons which he gives.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">133.	I also consider that the appellants&#8217; complaint about non-disclosure of relevant material to them has been substantiated.  Despite Mr. Collins&#8217;s submission to the contrary. I believe that this complaint is relevant on the judicial review.  This is by reason of the fact that the particularised findings of obstruction and hindrance arise directly and without more from the findings on the substantive issue, and the concealed material relates directly to these latter findings, because it relates to the credibility of Mr. Gogarty. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">134.	However, I do not believe that it would be proper or feasible for the Court to interfere with the decision on the substantive issue simply because the appellants, for reasons which seem to them sufficient, have not asked the Court to do so.  But the concealment clearly, and quite expressly, fed into the &#8220;obstruction and hindrance&#8221; findings, which was a major cause of the Order refusing costs.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">135.	I have read with great interest the quotations in the judgment of Fennelly J. cited above from a leading English authority on administrative law in relation to Tribunals of Inquiry.  As stated above, I agree with them.  This Tribunal manifests two features of a tribunal of inquiry which are, in my opinion, fraught with great risks for justice.  The first is that the investigative function - that carried out by the gardaí in relation to criminal matters - and the adjudicative function, or the function of making findings - that carried out by the Courts in criminal matters - are, in the case of a tribunal, conferred on a single body or even (as here before the retirement of the former Sole Member) on a single person. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">136.	The second risk is a corollary of the latter fact.  An investigator in a case where there is only one witness to support allegations made, whose evidence is subjectively accepted by the investigator, may become so invested in that one witness as to become blind or insensitive to things which raise doubt as to his credibility.  I believe that this is what happened in the case of </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">O&#8217;Callaghan v. Mahon</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, cited above, and that it may well have happened here.  It is a common phenomenon: in the well known miscarriage of justice case referred to as that of the &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Guilford Four</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221;, the investigating police officers were actually in possession of evidence providing an alibi for one of the four.  But they had become so convinced of their guilt that they decided the alibi could not be reliable and concealed it.  The Guilford Four spent over two decades in jail. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">137.	The foregoing illustrates the absolute centrality of proper disclosure to any approach informed by fair procedures.  Evidence or material which has even the potential to be useful to the person accused in making his own case or in undermining that of his accuser must be furnished to him.  The use to be made of such material is a matter, not for the investigators, but for the person accused and his chosen representatives.  It is for that reason that an extremely low threshold for disclosure of material should be applied. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">138.	These concerns are amplified in my mind by a number of others.  The Tribunal deliberately and consciously embarked on an inquiry, and arrived at conclusions to the effect that certain of the appellants had committed acts of obstruction and hindrance which were (a) outside its remit and (b) unnecessary to any function it had to perform.  It did so in a context where it positively emphasised that these matters were criminal offences.  Secondly, it was agreed on the hearing of this appeal that the Tribunal had resolved </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">every single </font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">conflict of fact against the appellants.  Thirdly, they withheld material from them which it is now admitted should have been disclosed and in doing so knew (as any lawyer must have known) they were gravely hampering the appellants in making their defence.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">139.	There is sometimes a tendency to be a little suspicious of persons who take legal proceedings against Tribunals of Inquiry on the basis that this itself is an act of obstruction.  I do not agree with this.  It is salutary to remember that the concealed materials would never have come to light in this case had the appellants not taken these proceedings.  It is chilling to reflect that a poorer person, treated in the same fashion by the tribunal, could not have afforded to seek this vindication.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">140.	I wish to emphasise that the fact of statutes creating certain offences capable of being committed only in relation to a person&#8217;s interaction with a tribunal does not mean that the tribunal in question itself has a jurisdiction to enquire into whether a person has acted in the manner proscribed by the statute.  On the contrary, that is exclusively a matter for the criminal courts, where the criminal onus of proof would apply and where, unless the offence alleged is a minor one, there will be an entitlement to trial by jury.  It is a fundamental error to think that, because an offence in its terms is created in relation to a tribunal, that the tribunal is therefore authorised or entitled to make a finding that the offence has been committed, whether or not such finding is regarded as binding on any other court or tribunal.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">141.	None of the foregoing implies that there is not an entitlement to establish a tribunal to inquire into whether criminal acts have been committed, whether by a named person or not.  As to whether (as the appellants submitted) such an inquiry would require a heightened standard of procedural protection for a person suspected of committing what amounts to a criminal offence, that is a point I would leave over, as being unnecessary to decide here.  I prefer to deal with this matter on the narrower but sufficient ground that this particular tribunal as constituted simply had no power to inquire into the question of &#8220;obstruction and hindrance&#8221; and, even for the purpose of costs, could have discharged its function quite adequately by simply considering the question of cooperation.  I cannot agree with the learned trial judge that the distinction between a finding of a failure to cooperate, and a finding of obstruction and hindrance is a mere matter of degree: that this is not so is evident from the Tribunal&#8217;s repeated references, quoted above, to obstruction and hindrance as being a criminal offence, and as something involving other serious consequences.  The Tribunal, for whatever reason, wanted to make a finding of criminal misconduct against the Murphys and did so.  But it had no need, and no power, to make the specific finding made.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">142.	Accordingly, on the substantive grounds that the findings on obstruction and hindrance are simply outside the terms of reference of the Tribunal, and on the several procedural grounds mentioned above, I would quash the decision on the 9th November, 2004 whereby the application of the appellants for their costs was refused. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">143.	Having done this, I do not propose to proceed to consider the appellants&#8217; claim that s.6 of 1979 Act as it now stands is unconstitutional.  It is unnecessary to do so and it has long been the practice to avoid pronouncing upon such a constitutional question where there is no need to do so to resolve the issues in a particular case.  I would however observe that, in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Goodman</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, so much cited above, the constitutionality of a Tribunal of Inquiry, at least one which enquires into matters which may reveal or constitute a criminal offence by some person, was established in a particular and very specific way.  This was on the basis that the findings of a tribunal have merely the status of opinions and that such opinions are &#8220;devoid of legal consequences&#8221; and do not impose any liabilities or affect any rights.  They are &#8220;sterile of legal effect&#8221;.  In the judgment in which the latter phrase is to be found, that of Brennan J. in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Victoria v. Australian Building Construction Employees Federation</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, cited above, it is followed by the apparently explanatory phrase (at pp. 152 to 153) where:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;It is not the nature of the facts to be found, but the legal effect of the finding which may stamp an inquiry as judicial&#8230; the absence of any legal effect in the findings of the Royal Commissioner appointed merely to inquire and report denies any suggestion that such a commissioner is exercising judicial power.&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">144.	Accordingly, in 1992 a challenge to the constitutionality of a Tribunal of Inquiry was rejected on the grounds that its &#8220;findings&#8221; were merely opinions, devoid of legal effect.  They were merely opinions, given &#8220;</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">in vacuo</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8221;.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">145.	There have been changes since then, notably in the form of the statute of the 1979 Act as amended.  This appears to elevate the &#8220;findings&#8221; of a tribunal into a matter to be taken into account on the question of costs - whether a party can receive his own costs or be made to bear the costs of others.  Whether a finding of this sort is &#8220;devoid of legal effect&#8221; is a matter which does not arise here, because of my decision that the impugned costs decision falls to be quashed on other less far reaching grounds, but will undoubtedly arise at no very distant date.  In </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Maguire v. Ardagh</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, cited above, I discussed at some length whether it was at all realistic to describe the finding of an Oireachtas Committee in relation to a possible unlawful killing as merely an &#8220;opinion&#8221;.  I now merely refer to this discussion again and to the observations on the meanings of words such as &#8220;finding&#8221; contained therein. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">146.	It is certainly within the power of the legislature to make provision for an award of costs before a Tribunal of Inquiry.  It did this in 1997 and had done so previously in 1979.  But whether this new power, conferred on a tribunal which provides for the individual notably attenuated procedural safeguards by comparison with those available in a court is consistent with the Tribunal&#8217;s established constitutional status which depends on its &#8220;findings&#8221; having the status merely of opinions and being &#8220;devoid of legal effect&#8221; is manifestly doubtful.  But the issue does not, in my opinion, arise directly in the present case so I propose to abstain from expressing a concluded view on it.</font>
