<b><u><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">JUDGMENT of Mr. Justice Hardiman delivered the 30th day of April, 2010.</font></u></b><br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	This is the appeal of the defendant against the judgment and order of the High Court (Gilligan J.). By order dated the 28th September, 2005, it was ordered that the plaintiff do have leave pursuant to s.41 of the Arbitration Act, 1954 to enforce an arbitration award of the 1st July, 2005 in the sum of &#8364;10,254,600 awarded by the Arbitrator in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendant.	</font><br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	The plaintiff herein, Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited (CSI) developed premises in Dublin known as the &#8220;National Aquatic Centre&#8221; at a cost which was agreed to exceed &#8364;62,000,000.00 (sixty-two million euro), exclusive of VAT. The significance of this figure will emerge below. On the 30th April, 2003, it created &#8220;a lease contract&#8221; in favour of the defendants, Dublin Waterworld Limited (DWW), in the said premises for a period of thirty years. </font><br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	The background issue in the present proceedings is whether VAT is payable on the creation of this interest in the premises, and if so in what amount. CSI took proceedings against the defendant claiming the sum of &#8364;10,254,600.00 relating to this VAT on the lease. On the 3rd June, 2005, the High Court (Kelly J.) ordered that the issue between the parties in respect of the claim for VAT be referred to arbitration. </font><br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	The Arbitrator made his award on the 5th July, 2005, whereby he awarded that the sum mentioned above being VAT charged by CSI on the capitalised value of the lease to the defendant was correctly charged. The plaintiff has taken proceedings seeking leave to enforce this award. The defendant seeks to set aside the award of the Arbitrator on the grounds discussed below.</font><br>
<br>
<b><u><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">The arbitration.</font></u></b><br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	It is important to note that, according to the Arbitrator&#8217;s award:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;The arbitration was conducted by way of a review of documents furnished by the representative of both parties and by an oral hearing held at the office of the Arbitrator on the 28th June, 2005.&#8221;</font><br>
<br>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">The dispute is summarised as follows:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;The issue in dispute is whether Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited was correct to charge valued added tax in the sum of &#8364;10,254,600.00 to Dublin Waterworld Limited on the capitalised value of the thirty year lease entered into by the parties on the 30th April, 2003.&#8221;</font><br>
<br>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	The Arbitrator noted that certain matters had been agreed between the parties. Due to their importance and the role they play in netting down the issues of this appeal I set them out in full:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><br>
<br>
<b><u><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">&#8220; &#8216;Agreed position&#8217;.</font></u></b><br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">It is accepted by both parties that the lease by CSI to DWW is a lease which would be subject to VAT at 13.5% on its capitalised value, subject to the provisions of s.4(3A) of the VAT Act, 1972 as amended. These provisions are commonly referred to as the &#8220;economic value test&#8221; or &#8220;EVT&#8221;. </font><br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">CSI as landlord and as the person disposing of its interest in the property submits that it was its responsibility to establish the capitalised value of the lease for VAT purposes.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">It is accepted by both parties that if the capitalised value of the lease was less than the economic value of the lease, the lease would be exempt from VAT. As a consequence, CSI would not be entitled to recover the VAT it incurred on the costs of developing the property. </font><br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">The economic value of the lease is the amount of money, excluding VAT, incurred by the landlord in acquiring and developing the property. In this case the economic value is accepted by both sides as being approximately &#8364;62,000.000.00. The exact figure is not available to the Arbitrator, but that fact is not critical. </font><br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">In order for the lease of the National Aquatic Centre to be subject to VAT, the capitalised value of the lease, determined in accordance with the provisions of the Act, would have to equal or exceed the economic value.&#8221;</font><br>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	As noted above, the economic value of the property is agreed. The issue between the parties therefore related to the capitalised value of the lease. </font><br>
<br>
<b><u><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">The lease and its actual terms.</font></u></b><br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	The actual rent, which was negotiated at arms length and specified in the lease mentioned as above, was &#8364;127,000.00 plus 10% of net profits. The maximum valuation of the net profits put forward by either side was &#8364;2.7 million, a figure which would give rise to an estimated maximum rent of &#8364;397,000.00. The lease further specified that after five years the rent was to be simply 10% of net profits i.e. an estimated maximum rent of &#8364;270,000.00. But in the two years preceding the arbitration, no profits were earned.</font><br>
<br>
<b><u><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">Statutory provisions.</font></u></b><br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	But, by virtue of the statutes and regulations considered below, the valuation of the lease is not based on the actual rent but is to some degree an artificial process. Firstly, by s.10(9) of the Act the value of the lease, being an interest in immovable goods, &#8220;shall be the open market price of such interest.&#8221;</font><br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	The &#8220;open market price&#8221;, is defined in the following in the subsection as the price which &#8220;the right to receive an unencumbered rent in respect of those goods for the period of the interest would fetch on the open market at the time that that interest is disposed of.&#8221; </font><br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	Section 32(1)(t) of the Act empowers the Revenue to make regulations to give effect to the Act in relation to &#8220;the valuation of interests in or over immovable goods&#8221;. The Revenue have done this and Regulation 19 of the VAT Regulations of 1979 (SI No. 63 of 1979) is of central importance. Its terms are explained, obviously without binding effect, in the Revenue publication &#8220;VAT and property transactions&#8221;, of October, 2001.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	</font><br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">Regulation 19 (1) provides:</font>
<p><b><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;19.</font></b><font size="5" face="Times New Roman"> (1) Where&#8212;</font>

</ul>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">the value of such rent to be included in the consideration for the purpose of ascertaining the open market price of the interest disposed of shall, in the absence of other evidence of the amount of that price, be&#8212;</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">(i) three-quarters of the annual amount of the rent multiplied by the number of complete years for which the rent has been created, or</font>
<p>
<p><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">(ii) the annual amount of the rent multiplied by the fraction of which the numerator is 100 and the denominator is the rate of interest (before deduction of income tax, if any) on the security of the Government which was issued last before the date of the creation of the rent for subscription in the State, and which is redeemable not less than five years after the date of issue (allowance having been made in calculating the interest for any profit or loss which will occur on the redemption of the security),</font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">whichever is the lower.&#8221;</font>
<p><br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	In purported reliance on the provisions of Regulation 19, CSI applied one of the formulae which produced an open market value in the sum of just under &#8364;76 million (compared to &#8364;35.00 million in the Valuation Office assessment, below). Applying either of the formulae set out above means that the open market value is a function of the rent. But DWW points out that the rental figure used to arrive at this sum of &#8364;76 million is more than eight times the actual rent agreed at arms length by CSI and itself, (&#8364;3.376 million as opposed to &#8364;127,000 plus notional profits, if any). There was uncontradicted evidence at the arbitration that there were no profits at all in either of the two next preceding years. Thus, the multiple would be much higher.</font><br>
<br>
<b><u><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">Valuation history.</font></u></b><br>
<b><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	</font></b><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">When a question of valuing the lease for VAT purposes first arose, CSI first had recourse to a professional valuer from the Valuation Office. But this expert&#8217;s advice was, from the point of view of CSI, devastating. He confirmed unencumbered rent to be &#8364;3,376,100 and the open market price for VAT purposes to be £35 million. The report of the expert, Mr. Liam Cahill ASCS, MRICS, MIAV is dated the 25th October, 2002. He discusses the difficulties of the valuation, principally that there were no comparable properties in the State and therefore no rental evidence available. He said:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;It is therefore necessary to adopt the contractors method of valuation and to consider the return acceptable to a developer in the market. The development cost has been supplied (by CSI), and at &#8364;63,220,950), the site extends to 3.44 hectares and estimate the value of the site at &#8364;1.25 million per hectare.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">I have adopted 5% to reflect the annual equivalent of the capital cost of providing the site and completed development.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">In arriving at an estimate of open market price I have adopted 8% of the gross all risk yield to reflect the quality of the income stream and determining nature of the interest.&#8221;</font><br>
<br>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	Accordingly, and based on a rent of &#8364;3.376 million per annum for thirty years @ 8%, Mr. Cahill came up with an estimated open market price for VAT purposes of &#8364;38,006,333 less acquisition costs giving an open market price of &#8364;35,054,725 (thirty-five million, fifty-four thousand seven hundred and twenty-five euro or &#8220;say thirty-five million&#8221;).</font><br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	From CSI&#8217;s point of view the problem with this was that the open market value (&#8364;35 million) was less than the Economic value which exceeded &#8364;60 million. Accordingly, the lease &#8220;failed&#8221; what is referred to as the EVT (Economic Value Test). Thus the lease would be VAT exempt. See the findings of the Arbitrator under &#8220;agreed position&#8221; at p.4 above.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	In order to avoid this CSI took certain steps which are central to the dispute. They are blandly described in a summary of the VAT issue transmitted by CSI solicitors to the Arbitrator under a cover of a letter dated 3rd June, 2005. This says:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;Regulation 19 of the VAT Regulations 1979 provides three methods for the valuation (capitalised value) of leases of ten years or longer in duration. The responsibility for determining the capitalised value of the lease rests with the lessor. CSI obtained a valuation of the unencumbered rent from the Valuation Office who determined the figure to be &#8364;3,376,000. The report confirms the unencumbered rent to be &#8364;3.376 million and the open market price for VAT purposes at &#8364;35m.&#8221;</font><br>
<br>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	The summary then goes on to describe the steps taken to produce a valuation which would not involve the transaction being VAT exempt as follows:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;Using the unencumbered rent, the &#8216;rent formula method outlined in Regulation 19(1)(c)(i) was used to determine the capitalised value of the lease. The Revenue Commissioners have expressly confirmed in a booklet entitled &#8216;VAT and Property Transactions&#8217; published by them in October 2001 (paragraph 2.2.1) that &#8216;the price may be ascertained in any one of the following ways and the tax payer may adopt whichever valuation he or she wishes&#8217;.</font><br>
<br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">This was restated by the Revenue Commissioners in their guidance notes for Inspectors dated 6th June, 2002 and the Anti-Avoidance Provisions of the Finance Act, 2002. CSI wrote to the Revenue Commissioners outlining the methodology used in his valuing the lease and by fax dated 1 May 2003 the Revenue Commissioners have confirmed that the methodology adopted was satisfactory.&#8221;</font><br>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	In other words CSI, having received an expert report which was devastating from their point of view, decided to use instead the first of the two formulae set out in Regulation 19 which produced a transaction which was liable to VAT, payable by DWW in an amount exceeding &#8364;10 million. </font><br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	Unsurprisingly, the parties differed as to whether this was a legitimate tactic for CSI to adopt. In this dispute, DWW emphasised the phrase in Regulation 19 &#8220;in the absence of other evidence of the amount of that price&#8221; as qualifying the power to apply whichever of the two available formulae which produces the lower valuation. They say that here there was ample &#8220;other evidence&#8221; in the form of a report of the valuer whose expertise was unchallenged. CSI, on the other hand, say that they, as lessors, are entitled in their own discretion to choose whichever of the rates of the methods of valuation available under Regulation 19 which commends itself to them. They rely on the Revenue document &#8220;VAT and Property Transaction&#8221; (sic) already referred to and in particular on paragraph 2.2.1 thereof which says:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;The capital value of a rent created in connection with the disposal of an interest in property in a commercial-arms-length transaction is the price including tax, which the right to receive the unencumbered rent would fetch in the open market. The price may be ascertained in any one of the following ways and the tax payer may adopt whichever valuation he or she wishes:</font><br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">(a)	On a valuation made by a competent valuer (i.e. open market value) or </font><br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">(b)	The first fomula or </font><br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">(c)	The second formula</font><br>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">whichever is the lesser but see the follow paragraph.&#8221;</font><br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	The rest of the relevant portion of the Revenue document is not important for present purposes. </font><br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	It must, of course, be noted that the Revenue document carries the disclaimer, in a prominent place at the end of the introduction:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;Nothing in this guide should be taken as overriding the legal provisions or requirements of the Value Added Tax Act, 1972 (as amended).</font><br>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">It also noteworthy that CSI contend that they, as lessors are entitled to choose the method of valuation and that it is not open to the other party, DWW in this case, to dispute the valuation or the VAT claim. This contention, too, appears in the summary mentioned above. </font><br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	DWW emphasised that the arbitration was to be conducted on a review of the documents and indeed CSI solicitors in writing to the Arbitrator suggested that there was no need for an oral hearing at all: &#8216;we suggest that you should have sufficient documentation before you to make a decision without calling oral evidence from either party&#8217;. DWW emphasised that the report of Mr. Cahill was amongst the documentation supplied to the Arbitrator and say that it was before him as &#8216;evidence&#8217;. Therefore, DWW say, the case was obviously not one which featured &#8216;the absence of other evidence as to the amount&#8217; of the open market price so that, based on the wording of Regulation 19, there was no scope for CSI to invoke either of the formulae. </font><br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	This was the nature of the dispute which went before the Arbitrator.  DWW made it clear that they were by no means happy with the estimated rent arrived at by Mr. Cahill having regard to the actual rent agreed between the parties. He indicated that there had been no surplus in 2003 and 2004 so that the specified amount of rent was all that was payable and this was a small fraction of the &#8364;3.376 million, being only &#8364;127,000. Moreover, DWW relied on the enormous variations in the open market price between the &#8364;35 million from Mr. Cahill and the &#8364;76 million figure from the Landlord. It was said that such a gap was manifestly absurd.</font><br>
<br>
<b><u><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">Notional and real rents.</font></u></b><br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	If one is allowed for a moment to have regard to the real-world position of these parties, it is clear that they agreed between themselves a rent, for the first five years of a thirty year term, of &#8364;127,000 per annum plus 10% of the profits. In the two years preceding the arbitration there were no profits, so that the rent entitlement was merely &#8364;127,000.00. But it is important to bear in mind, as the Arbitrator found, that the VAT Regulations known as the Value Added Tax (Amendment) (Property Transactions) Regulations 2002 for the first time introduced the following provision to the valuation of interests in immovable property, by amendment of Regulation 19 which is quoted above:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;However, where the rent payable in respect of the interests so created is less than the unencumbered rent in respect of that interest the value of the rent to be included in the consideration for the purpose of ascertaining the open market price of the interest disposed of shall be calculated using the unencumbered rent.&#8221;</font><br>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">The significance of this provision, for the purposes of the present case, is very considerable. As the Arbitrator found, both the lease and the rent, are encumbered. The Arbitrator said at p.4 of his award:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;In calculating the capitalised value of the lease, CSI considered that the rent provided in the lease was encumbered. The lease provides an annual rent in each of the first five years of £100,000 (or &#8364;127,000 approximately, plus 10% of net profits). But it also provides that DWW will make available to CSI certain facilities in the centre free of charge for 1300 hours per annum. The lease and the rent, therefore are encumbered.&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	The consequence of this, by reason of the 2002 Amendment quoted above, is that the unencumbered rent, as opposed to the encumbered rent is to be used. But the property is in fact significantly encumbered by obligations grounded in public policy: to value the lease in the property as if there were no such encumberances is obviously going to give rise to an unreal result.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	CSI is an ordinary company but, according to information supplied at the arbitration, the share holders in it are various government ministers. The Arbitrator regarded it as being a State company. Whether for that reason or for some other reason, it created a lease which considerably hampered, one might think, the commercial use of the premises. Basically, it had to be used, in part, as a facility for the training and development of elite swimmers and this use was free of charge. Obviously, a higher rent would be available if this condition did not exist in the lease. The Court of course has no idea, and no evidence, as to precisely what that higher rent would be. </font><br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	Even making every allowance for the factor described above, there is no doubt that there is a huge difference between the &#8220;unencumbered rent&#8221; as calculated by Mr. Cahill (which he did on the basis of so much per hectare), and the actual rent agreed between the parties whom, it was said without contradiction, were acting at arms length, both of them being professionally advised. Moreover, the notional unencumbered rent is also a very large multiple of the valuation arrived at by Messrs. Hamilton Osbourne King, who were also retained and gave evidence before the Arbitrator of a rental value of &#8364;300,000 per annum. Indeed, of the various figures proposed in respect of rent it is evident that only the figure produced by the use of one of the formulae would produce an open market value which would exceed the economic cost, thereby making the transaction vatable in the first place. </font><br>
<br>
<b><u><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">The Arbitrator&#8217;s findings.</font></u></b><br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	The complaints made by DWW about the arbitration findings centre on two passages, both at p.5 of the award. The Arbitrator, who is a recognised VAT expert (though sitting as an arbitrator, not an expert) held:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;In my opinion, the opinion of the Valuation Office that the open market price of the interest being disposed of by CSI is &#8364;35 million </font><u><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">is not evidence of the open market price.</font></u><font size="5" face="Times New Roman"> </font><u><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">The nature of the property is unique with no close comparison in the State.</font></u><font size="5" face="Times New Roman"> </font><u><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">Therefore, in my opinion, the figure of &#8364;35 million is an estimate and does not provide evidence of its open market price.</font></u><br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">I believe, therefore, that CSI was quite entitled to use an unencumbered rent figure to calculate the capitalised value of the lease by means of one of the prescribed formulae in Regulation 19.&#8221;</font><br>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	This passage appears to me to mean that the condition precedent to the use of the one of the formulae - that there should be an absence of other evidence of the open market value - was in fact met in this case because the Valuation Offices valuation &#8220;is not evidence because it is an estimate&#8221;. There was, therefore, an &#8220;absence of other evidence&#8221;, allowing a formula to be used.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	Before addressing this proposition it is convenient to consider the other passage which has given rise to complaint. The Arbitrator said:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;&#8230; It (CSI) engaged the input of professional valuers who, it is clear to me, understood fully the nature of the assignment in giving an opinion as to the value of an unencumbered rent of the property. I believe that CSI were entitled to rely on that opinion. It would be absurd to expect a non-qualified person to question the professional judgement of a qualified valuer. The VAT system could not function effectively if a supplier&#8217;s VAT charge was subject to review by his customer.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">The fact that an alternative valuation may be put on the rent of the property by another valuer is in my opinion of no relevance. CSI has fulfilled its responsibilities under the VAT legislation by calculating the capitalised value of the lease at an open market price using an unencumbered rent on which it is entitled to rely&#8230;&#8221;.</font><br>
<br>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	The only professional valuer retained by CSI before the reference to arbitration, on the evidence, is the Valuation Office. The opinion of that office, acting through Mr. Cahill, emerges clearly from his report:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;In my opinion the unencumbered rent is &#8364;3.376 million and the open market price for VAT is &#8364;35 million.&#8221;</font><br>
<br>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	The methods whereby Mr. Cahill arrived at this valuation are clearly set out in his report and are quoted earlier in this judgment. Mr. Cahill addressed the precise point raised by the Arbitrator, that there were no close comparators in the State. The Arbitrator did not dissent or differ from Mr. Cahill&#8217;s valuation in a reasoned way. Instead, he seemed to find that it was not evidence at all because it was an estimate. </font><br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	In my view, any opinion on the value of a property and especially one which purports to value, not the actual market value of the actual interest created subject to the specific terms and conditions that actually exist, but a theoretical, notional unencumbered value, is of necessity in the nature of an estimate. Any professional valuer who expressed his view in terms of a precise figure and made no allowance for any variation at all would in my view be wholly lacking in credibility. Mr. Cahill&#8217;s opinion is that of a Chartered Surveyor whose expertise has not been challenged and who is a district valuer in the Valuation Office. In my view, having regard to the documentary basis on which the arbitration was to be conducted, and on the basis on which Mr. Cahill&#8217;s report was sent to the Arbitrator, it constituted evidence before him. The Arbitrator was entitled to dissent from it in a reasoned way but he was not entitled to disregard on the basis that it was not evidence.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	The Arbitrator might, perhaps, have taken issue with the &#8220;contractors&#8217; methods&#8221; of valuation or with the 8% figure adopted in the portion quoted earlier in this judgment. But he did neither, nor did he differ from the valuation on any reasoned basis: he simply asserted that the valuation was not evidence at all. </font><br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	Speaking of the second passage to which exception is taken, the learned trial judge said, at p.14 of his judgment:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;I am satisfied that the arbitrator made an incorrect statement of the law when he indicated that the VAT system could not function effectively if a supplier&#8217;s VAT charge was subject to review by his customer, having regard to the judgment of the Supreme Court in </font><i><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">Forbes v. Tobin</font></i><font size="5" face="Times New Roman"> (unreported, Supreme Court, 17 July 2002)...&#8221;.</font><br>
<br>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">Neither side has appealed from this statement and, to judge by the recent submissions of the parties, it appears to be accepted on both sides. However, the learned trial judge continued:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;&#8230; But in my view this statement cannot be regarded as a fundamental error of law on the face of the award, or of having any significant impact on the decision of the arbitrator.&#8221;</font><br>
<br>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	</font><b><u><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">Forbes v. Tobin</font></u></b><font size="5" face="Times New Roman"> was a case where the High Court had declined to  make an order of specific performance in relation to a contract for the sale of land. A special condition provided as follows:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;(7)	In addition to the purchase price the purchaser shall pay to the vendor an amount equivalent to such value added tax as shall be exigible in relation to the sale, same to be calculated in accordance with the provisions of the Value Added Tax Act 1972 and to be paid on completion of the sale forthwith upon receipt by the purchaser of an appropriate invoice&#8230;&#8221;.</font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	In reversing the High Court&#8217;s refusal to grant specific performance the Supreme Court, per Murphy J. said:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;In my view the learned trial judge erred in concluding that the purchaser refused to pay value added tax. His only refusal was to pay value added tax, first, on the erroneous basis that the contract was one for the sale of a business and, secondly, on the basis that the property had been developed by the vendors or their predecessors in title, without being given adequate evidence to support that contention. The purchaser expressed and demonstrated his willingness to pay the value added tax if the same was payable and for that purpose sought evidence - as opposed to opinions or rulings - to enable a conclusion to be reached by the purchaser in that regard.&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	This decision, in which Denham J. and Murray J. (as he then was) concurred, plainly supports the proposition that a person from whom value added tax is demanded, at least on the sale of immovable property, is entitled to some evidence that such tax is actually due, and due in the amount claimed. This, in turn, seems quite inconsistent with the statement of the Arbitrator and in any event, as noted above, his proposition was not stood over on the hearing of this appeal.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	The respondent&#8217;s position on the hearing of this appeal was that it did not need to rely on the statement by the Arbitrator that &#8220;the VAT system could not function effectively if a supplier&#8217;s VAT charge was subject to review by his customer&#8230; the fact that an alternative valuation may be put forward on the rent of the property by another valuer is in my opinion of no relevance&#8221;.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	This, indeed, is a rather strange statement. If taken literally it would mean that the supplier of goods or services could decide the amount of the VAT in an un-reviewable fashion. Viewed in this light, it would undermine the basis of the arbitration itself which sought to review the Landlord&#8217;s determination as to whether this transaction was vatable and in what amount. However, on the hearing of this appeal CSI made two points about it:</font><br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">(1)	It does not form part of the </font><i><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">ratio</font></i><font size="5" face="Times New Roman"> of the award at all and</font><br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">(2)	It did not have a significant impact on the award.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	I cannot agree with the learned trial judge&#8217;s finding, quoted above, or with the submissions just summarised. This was a dispute as to whether the charge to VAT raised, in a sum exceeding &#8364;10 million, by CSI on DWW was correct. This, in turn, clearly raised the question of whether the transaction was subject to VAT, and if so in what amount. </font><br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	It was against this background that the Arbitrator made the statements which he did and which have been agreed, and held by the High Court, to be incorrect. If a customer could not review his supplier&#8217;s VAT charge then the whole basis of the dispute between the parties, and thus of the reference to arbitration, would be undermined. If, in the Arbitrator&#8217;s view the customer (here DWW) could not review CSI&#8217;s VAT charge, so that any evidence which it might adduce on that question was simply irrelevant, then it is hard to see what the Arbitrator was doing in arbitrating between the parties. It is hard to see why he dismissed Mr. Cahill&#8217;s opinion as not constituting evidence at all if the true position was (as they seem to think) that it was simply entirely irrelevant.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	In my opinion this is a serious misstatement of the law appearing on the face of the award. I am of the same view in relation to the finding that Mr. Cahill&#8217;s opinion was not evidence, because it was an estimate, for the reasons given above. Each of these errors supports the view, which I hold, that Mr. O&#8217;Brien simply did not give any consideration to the case advanced by DWW but decided that CSI were entitled to have recourse to the formula and that that concluded the matter. </font><br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	I am further of the view that the Arbitrator gravely misled himself on the law in determining that CSI were, entirely at their own option, entitled to rely on the formula. Regulation 19, insofar as relevant, has been quoted above. One thing that is clear from it, and from the Guidance Publications issued by the Revenue Commissioners, is that one may establish the appropriate value by the evidence of a qualified valuer. But neither the Arbitrator nor the Revenue in issuing their guidance paid sufficient attention to the presence, in Regulation 19 and specifically in introducing the two formulae of the phrase &#8220;in the absence of other evidence of the amount of that price&#8221;.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	Quite simply, there was not an absence of other evidence in this case. Furthermore, it is clear from the Revenue document of October 2001 itself that it does not purport to amend the 1979 Regulations, which have the force of law.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	The Court had opened to it on the hearing of this appeal a considerable volume of case law on the topic of arbitrations and attempts to set them aside which, in general, do not raise any contentious issue. In general, as this Court said in </font><b><u><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">Doyle v. Kildare County Council</font></u></b><b><font size="5" face="Times New Roman"> </font></b><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">[1995] 2 IR 424, the Court has no statutory jurisdiction to set aside the award of an Arbitrator in the absence of a finding that he has misconducted himself, or misconducted the proceedings, pursuant to s.38(1) of the Arbitration Act, 1954 as amended. In </font><b><u><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">McCarthy v. Keane and Ors.</font></u></b><font size="5" face="Times New Roman"> (Supreme Court, unreported 16th December, 2004), Fennelly J. had this to say about the meaning of the term &#8220;misconduct&#8221; which is a term of art:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;Real cases of misconduct may arise in the conduct of the arbitration, where the arbitrator acts unfairly either by clear acts of favouritism towards a party or adopts procedures which place one or the other party (or perhaps even both) at a clear disadvantage.&#8221;</font><br>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	He continued: </font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;It seems to me that the standard or test of misconduct of such a nature would be something substantial, something that smacks of injustice or unfairness. One of the cited examples is of an arbitrator inspecting the farm he was to value in the presence of one party and in the absence of the other&#8230; there is a sharp distinction between acts committed in the course of the arbitration and its result. Mere error is not misconduct. Parties submit disputes, including disputes as to the law to arbitration. They expect the arbitrator to rule in all matters in dispute but they do not have a guarantee that the arbitrator will reach the correct result. An arbitrator may err in his interpretation of the law or of the facts, without being guilty of misconduct.&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	On the topic of error of law on the face of the record, I would gratefully adopt what was said by O&#8217;Donnell J. in this Court in </font><b><u><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">Galway City Council v. Samuel Kingston Construction Limited</font></u></b><font size="5" face="Times New Roman"> (Supreme Court, unreported, 25th March, 2010) as follows:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;Thirdly, the court has a common law jurisdiction to set aside or remit an award for an error of law on the face of the record. In Church &amp; General Insurance Co. v. Connolly &amp; McLoughlin (Unreported, High Court, 7th May, 1981), Costello J. stated that &#8216;there is no doubt that at common law the Court can either remit or set aside an award if there is an error of law on its face&#8217;. This jurisdiction, according to McCarthy J. in Keenan at p. 96, is limited to &#8216;an error of law so fundamental that the courts cannot stand aside and allow it to remain unchallenged&#8217;. In McStay v. Assicurazioni Generali SPA &amp; Anor [1991] 2 I.L.R.M. 237, Finlay C.J. stated at p. 243 that, where an arbitrator decides a question of law in respect of which the general issue in dispute, but not the precise question of law, is submitted to him, the court &#8216;may in its discretion and in particular cases where the decision so expressed is clearly wrong on its face, intervene by way of remitting the matter or otherwise in the interests of justice. Thus, as noted by Clarke J. in Limerick City Council v. Uniform Construction Ltd. [2007] 1 I.R. 30 at p.43, the jurisdiction is &#8220;limited and arises only where the error is &#8216;so fundamental&#8217; that it cannot be allowed to stand (Keenan v. Shield Insurance Company Ltd.) or &#8216;clearly wrong&#8217; (McStay v. Assicurazione Generali SPA &amp; Anor)&#8221;.</font><br>
<br>

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<b><u><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">Nature of the Arbitrator&#8217;s errors.</font></u></b><br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	In my view, the errors identified above which afflicted the arbitration are of a nature &#8220;so fundamental that the Courts cannot stand aside and allow [them] to remain unchallenged&#8221;.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	It is interesting to note that they are all of a cognate nature. The Arbitrator expressed the view that the VAT system could not work if a customer was allowed to challenge or review his suppliers charged to VAT. This is legally incorrect for the reasons set out above. Although (as CSI point out) it occurs towards the end of the Arbitrator&#8217;s finding I am not convinced that for that or any other reason it had no input into that finding. The other errors were, first, to find that CSI were entitled to use the formulae. But these formulae do not produce any binding result unless there is an absence of other evidence of the price. There plainly was such evidence in the form of Mr. Cahill&#8217;s report. But the Arbitrator held that this was merely &#8220;an estimate&#8221; and not &#8220;evidence&#8221;.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	One of the attractions of arbitration as a means of solving disputes is that it can, with the agreement of both parties, proceed with relative informality. Where, as in this case, it was envisaged that the arbitration would consist of a review of the documents, I believe the documents sent to the Arbitrator are in the nature of evidence, without formal proof. In any event Mr. Tobin went and gave evidence before the Arbitrator, </font><i><font size="5" face="Times New Roman">viva voce</font></i><font size="5" face="Times New Roman"> in which he stood over his valuation. There is no conceivable basis, in my view, on which this material can be excluded from the category of &#8220;evidence&#8221; in the context of the arbitration.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	I have no doubt that these are significant and fundamental errors on the face of the award. They enabled CSI not so much to succeed at the arbitration, as to register a walkover. The most substantial part of their evidence was quite wrongly excluded from consideration, and on that basis a formula which is plainly adverse to Dublin Waterworld&#8217;s  interests was used. This was on the basis that their evidence was not in fact &#8220;evidence&#8221; at all and the Arbitrator indicated that the Landlord&#8217;s determination as to VAT could not be reviewed by the tenant.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	These are all grave and significant matters in the context of this arbitration and I would set aside the award.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="5" face="Times New Roman">	If desired by the parties, the Court will hear submissions as to the precise form of the order that should be made in light of the foregoing judgment. </font>
