<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Judgment delivered the 25th  day of January, 2007 by Denham J. </font></b>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">1. 	This is an appeal by D.T., the applicant/appellant, hereinafter referred to as 'the applicant', from a decision of the High Court (Smyth J.) delivered on the 14th May, 2004 in which the learned High Court judge refused to injunct the trial of the applicant in respect of charges arising out of the complaint of P.K..  There is also a cross appeal on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the respondent/cross appellant, hereinafter referred to as 'the respondent', from the order of the High Court injuncting proceedings in relation to the complaint of C.K.. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. 	The proceedings commenced on the 21st January, 2002 when the applicant was granted leave by the High Court (Ó Caoimh J.) to apply by way of an application for judicial review for an injunction restraining the respondent from proceeding or taking any further steps in a criminal prosecution pending before the Central Criminal Court against the applicant in respect of Newtownmountkennedy Charge Sheets 7/2001 to 100/2001 inclusive bearing Bill No. 46/01J.  The applicant was given leave to apply for judicial review on four of five grounds sought, being that:  </font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">(i) 	by reason of inordinate and inexcusable delay, the applicant has been deprived of his right to a fair trial with due expedition in breach of his Constitutional rights to fair procedures pursuant to Article 38.1 of the Constitution; </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii)	the applicant has been prejudiced in his defence of these proceedings by reason of the delay in his case being brought to trial; </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iii)	there is a real and substantial risk that the trial of the applicant will be unfair by reason of the delay and consequent prejudice resulting therefrom;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	. . . </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(v)	the trial of the applicant has not occurred with due or reasonable expedition; furthermore the delay cannot be justified or excused.  </font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	The fourth ground, which raised issues of specificity, was refused.  </font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">3.	The offences alleged are: </font></b>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">(i) 	40 offences of buggery committed against P.K. on various dates between 1976 and 1980; </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii) 	40 offences of indecent assault committed against P.K. on various dates between 1976 and 1980; </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iii)	4 offences of indecent assault committed against C.K., a brother of P.K., during 1978 and 1979; </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iv)	2 offences of indecent assault committed against M.W. in 1978. </font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">4.	In the High Court counsel for the applicant addressed his submissions and legal arguments to the period between the dates of the alleged offences and the dates of complaints being made to the Garda Síochána in October 2000.  The facts were set out by the learned trial judge.  The applicant was the employer of the three complainants.  He was a friend of the parents of P.K. and C.K. (who are brothers) and visited their home from time to time.  All the complainants were schoolboys in their early teens at the time when they were employed by the applicant in his business.  P.K. was 13 years old when he went to work for the applicant and he worked for the applicant for four summers until he did his Leaving Certificate and went to college.  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	The learned trial judge sets out in detail the explanation given by the complainants as to why they had not made an official complaint earlier.  He also describes and analyses the evidence of Mr. Desmond O'Mahony, Clinical Psychologist, as to the reasons for the delay in reporting the alleged offences, whom he observed giving evidence.  However, this aspect of the judgment is not now in issue or relevant since the decision of this Court in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">H. v. The Director of Public Prosecutions</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2006] I.E.S.C. 55.  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	The learned trial judge addressed the issue of a fair trial.  There was evidence before the High Court as to the applicant's ability to defend himself.  The learned High Court judge stated that the applicant had difficulties at school in keeping up with his class and rather poor educational achievements and that the medical evidence was that up to 16th September, 1983 he &#8220;may have been functioning intellectually in dull to normal range&quot;.  In 1983 he suffered personal injuries and was described as of the 24th May, 1984 as &#8220;suffering from brain damage from a fat embolism&quot;.  The learned trial judge describes that in July 1986 a consultant psychiatrist stated on examining the applicant that he had &quot;memory difficulties with very poor recall and short term memory&quot;.  However, this was not found as to his long term memory.  The learned trial judge also considered other medical evidence as to the applicant's memory and ability and held:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">	&quot;I am satisfied and find as a matter of fact and of law that the alleged cognitive impairment of the Applicant in this case is not such as to expose him to a real or substantial or serious risk of an unfair trial.  I am likewise satisfied and so find that the Applicant has not been, as submitted, fatally hampered in preparing a defence to the proceedings involving PK.  I am satisfied that the replies given by the Applicant to the Garda, allowing for denials, evasions and deferrals, show a memory for time, place and details.&quot; </font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	However, while the High Court permitted the trial in relation to P.K., the High Court prohibited the trial in relation to the complaints of M.W. and C.K. in the following words: </font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">	&quot;The only evidence [of] credibility and consistency of complaints the Applicant will be called upon to deal with is that of PK.  I have no hesitation in prohibiting the trial of the charges grounded on the complaint of MW and while I have some doubt for the reasons expressed at the hearing concerning the charges grounded in the complaints of CK, I am prepared to give the benefit of that doubt to the Applicant and prohibit the trial on those charges.&quot;</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">5. 	In the applicant's Notice of Appeal from the judgment of the High Court, many of the grounds relate to the reasons for the delay, the ability of the applicant arising from the road traffic accident in 1983, alleged brain damage arising thereform, and the learned High Court judge's account of the medical evidence.  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	Written submissions were filed on behalf of both parties.  Supplemental submissions were filed on behalf of the applicant in light of </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">H. v. The Director of Public Prosecutions</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2006] IESC 55. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	The respondent filed a cross appeal in relation to the order made in respect of the charges involving C.K. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">6. 	In this case the applicant has sought to prohibit his trial of alleged offences committed years ago against young persons.  The jurisprudence relating to lengthy delays by complainants in this type of judicial review was revisited and restated by this Court in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">H. v. The Director of Public Prosecutions</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">.  Whereas for over a decade the courts had looked at the reasons for the delay in making complaints by persons who had been abused as children, the Court has determined now that this exercise is no longer required.  Arising from a decade of experience in such cases, there is judicial knowledge of the reasons why children may not make official complaints until many years after such abuse.  Consequently, the test for a court in considering whether a trial should proceed where there has been such delay relates solely to the issue of fair trial.  The test was described in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">H. v. The Director of Public Prosecutions</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as: </font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">	&quot;Therefore, the Court is satisfied that it is no longer necessary to establish such reasons for delay.  The issue for the Court is whether the delay has resulted in prejudice to an accused so as to give rise to a real or serious risk of an unfair trial.  The Court would thus restate the test as: </font>
<ul><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	&quot;The test is whether there is a real or serious risk that the applicant, by reason of the delay, would not obtain a fair trial, or that a trial would be unfair as a consequence of the delay.  The test is to be applied in light of the circumstances of the case.&quot; </font></ul>
<br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	Thus, the first inquiry as to the reasons for the delay in making a complaint need no longer be made.  As a consequence any question of an assumption, which arose solely for the purpose of applications of this nature, of the truth of the complainants' complaints against an applicant no longer arises.  The inquiry which should be made is whether that degree of prejudice is such as to give rise to a real or serious risk of an unfair trial.  The factors of prejudice, if any, will depend upon the circumstances of the case.&quot; </font></ul>
<br>
</ul>
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">7. 	Decision</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	The decision in this appeal is made on current jurisprudence.  It is a case where the law has evolved since the decision in the High Court.   </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7.1	While the reasons for the delay by the complainants in making the complaints were carefully considered and the then law applied by the learned trial judge, this aspect of the case is no longer of relevance.  Consequently, this extensive part of the High Court judgment and the related grounds on the original notice of appeal are not live issues on the appeal. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7.2	Counsel on behalf of the applicant submitted that it was apparent from the medical evidence that there was a real or serious risk of an unfair trial.  He referred to the road traffic accident in 1983 when he argued that the applicant had sustained very serious injuries, including brain damage.  He canvassed the evidence as to the applicant's health.  He submitted that the applicant was consequently prejudiced and could not get a fair trial.  Counsel submitted that because of the history of this case, in all the circumstances, in light of the evidence, it was permissible for the court to intervene.  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7.3	I am satisfied that these are not grounds upon which to intervene by way of judicial review to injunct the trial of the applicant.  The issue raised on behalf of the applicant is his alleged disability, his capacity.  Such is not part of the jurisprudence on delay and the right to a fair trial, it is not an issue of prejudice caused by delay. Incapacity or disability may arise in situations where there is no delay. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	If there are issues as to the applicant's capacity there are separate specific procedures to be applied.  It is a matter for the trial court to determine a person's fitness to stand trial.  The issue of the fitness of an applicant was raised also recently in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">J.B. v. The Director of Public Prosecutions</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (Unreported, Supreme Court, 29th November, 2006) in which I held: </font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">	&quot;Thirdly, there was reference to medical reports being sought as to his capacity to instruct counsel.  That is an entirely different issue to the stress test as expounded in P.M. v. Malone.  It is not an issue before this Court.  The capacity of the applicant to plead is a matter which may more appropriately be raised  before the trial judge.&quot; </font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	Also, in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">J.K. v. The Director of Public Prosecutions</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (Unreported, Supreme Court, 27th October, 2006) McGuinness J. refused to accept that the applicant's health problems were 'wholly exceptional circumstances' as referred to in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">H. v. The Director of Public Prosecutions</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, and stated that it is a matter for the trial judge.  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	Applying the law to the facts of this case I am satisfied that the issue of the applicant's fitness to plead is a matter for the appropriate law and the trial court and that the applicant's submissions on this ground fail.  The issue of his capacity or disability is not an exceptional circumstance under </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">H. v. The Director of Public Prosecutions</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7.4	In essence when this case was commenced the applicant sought to prohibit his trial on the grounds of delay based on the medical and related evidence given as to the reasons for the delay by the complainants in making a complaint.  Such delay of itself is no longer a basis upon which the applicant may succeed under the evolving jurisprudence.  The applicant now seeks to injunct his trial on the basis of his incapacity.  It is not a basis upon which he was granted leave to appeal - and so the appeal could be dismissed on that basis alone.  However, because this case was on the cusp of the developing jurisprudence, I have considered the issues raised on behalf of the applicant.  I am satisfied that the appeal is misconceived in that the issues go to the capacity of the applicant and not to the jurisprudence on delayed trials.  It would be entirely inappropriate to try the issue of capacity and disability on affidavits and cross examination by way of judicial review.  While reference was made to the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act, 2006 and the rules and procedures governing the issue of fitness to be tried I make no finding as to that procedure. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	No issue of prosecutorial delay arose in this case. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7.5		Thus, the test to be applied is that stated in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">H. v. The Director of Public Prosecutions</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, as set out previously in this judgment.  Applying that test, I am satisfied that the applicant has not established that by reason of delay there is a real or serious risk that the applicant would not obtain a fair trial or that the trial would be unfair as a consequence of the delay. The issue of the capacity of the applicant is not a matter within this judicial review, it is a matter for the trial court.  Thus the learned trial judge erred in so far as he considered and made a determination as to the 'alleged cognitive impairment' of the applicant.  Further, the applicant P.K. has not raised any matters which may be considered to be an exception under </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">H. v. The Director of Public Prosecutions</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">. </font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">8.	Conclusion </font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	For the reasons given I would dismiss the appeal of the applicant, and affirm the decision of the High Court.  Consequently the trial in relation to the complaints of P.K. is not injuncted by these proceedings.  Of course, this review does not exclude any appropriate application to the trial judge. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	In all the circumstances of the case, which include the fact that this appeal has occurred at a time when the relevant jurisprudence has been developing, the view taken by the trial judge that the only evidence of credibility and consistency of complaints which the applicant will be called upon to deal with is that of P.K., and the overall requirement to balance factors in the interest of justice, I would dismiss the cross appeal of the respondent.  Consequently I would affirm the decision of the learned trial judge that the trial of the applicant on foot of the complaints of C.K. be prohibited. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	The issue of a trial of the applicant arising out of the complaints of M.W. was not before this Court on appeal and therefore remains prohibited by the order and judgment of the High Court.    </font>
