<ul><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">RULING of the Court on the Question of Costs delivered by Murray C.J. on the 6th day of May 2009.</font></u></b>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		1.	The plaintiff was the victim of sexual assault when she was a schoolgirl.  The perpetrator of the assaults was the first named defendant, a lay teacher in her school who </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">			assaulted her when he was giving her individual, or extra curricular, music lessons in a classroom.   She successfully sued Mr. Hickey for damages and was awarded the sum </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">			of £305,104.  Unsurprisingly that defendant did not have the resources to pay those damages and the Court was informed that he is now required to pay the plaintiff a 	</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">			monthly amount  for the remainder of his life.  The plaintiff also sought and obtained redress from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal.  That award was for the sum </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">			of &#8364;53,000 for compensation and expenses.</font><br>
<br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		2.	Separately from the foregoing the plaintiff, in these proceedings, claimed further damages and sought to attach liability for the assaults to the Minister and the other defendants </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">			in these proceedings on the grounds that the Minister, or the State through the Minister, was vicariously liable for the acts of the teacher.  One of the principal premises on </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">			which the plaintiff sought to attach liability to the Minister was that there was an employer/employee relationship between the teacher and the Minister as a consequence of </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">			which the Minister and the State, although themselves not guilty of any wrongdoing, bore vicarious liability for the acts of the teacher.  There were also other grounds upon </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">			which the plaintiff sought to attach liability to the Minister and the State defendants but it is not necessary to go into them for present purposes.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		3.	Her action against the Minister and the other State defendants was dismissed in the High Court.  She appealed against that dismissal and her appeal was dismissed.</font><br>
<br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		4.	The State has sought costs against the appellant pursuant to the general principle that the losing party must pay the successful party&#8217;s costs.  The equity of that general </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">			principle is obvious.  In principle a party who has been found to be innocent of any wrongdoing or liability should be indemnified in his or her costs by the unsuccessful party </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">			who brought them to court.  </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		5.	As is well established, the Courts have a discretion to depart from the general principle according to which the costs follow the event where there are special or exceptional </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">			circumstances in a particular case.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		6.	In this case counsel for the appellant has pointed out that this case was a test case governing a significant number of  pending cases on a very substantive issue which </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">			concerned the vicarious liability of the Minister for Education for sexual assaults on pupils by primary school teachers, whose salaries are paid by the Minister.  That it was an </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">			important test case was not disputed by the Minister.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		7.	In </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Cork County Council v. Shackelton &amp; Anor (The High Court 12th October 2007 Unreported)</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> Clarke J. outlined certain general principles, with which the Court </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">			agrees, applicable to costs in test cases.  These were:</font><br>

<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;Where the proceedings involve entirely private parties then there does not seem to me to be any proper basis for departing from the ordinary rule in relation to costs, notwithstanding the fact that the case may properly be described as a test case.  There is no good reason for depriving a successful private party of its ordinary entitlement to costs simply because the case in which it succeeded happens to be a test case.</font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">However it seems to me that different considerations may apply, at least in some cases, where one of the parties is a public authority.  To take a case at the other end of the spectrum from the purely private litigation which I have just considered, one can envisage circumstances where a court was faced with difficult questions of construction in relation to legislation of widespread and general application which was introduced by a particular ministry (sic) and in circumstances where that ministry is a necessary and proper party to the proceedings under consideration.  An analogous situation might arise where Ireland was a necessary party.  In those circumstances it seems to me that it is open to the Court to weigh in the balance in considering costs the fact (if it be so and to the extent that it is so) that the litigation may have been necessitated by the complexity or difficulty of legislation for which, of course, either the Minister concerned or Ireland, was in substance responsible.&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		8.	As Clarke J. also pointed out a test case in the broadest sense may be said to arise in many circumstances where there is an issue concerning the law, a statute or the </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">			Constitution to be resolved.  Simply because a case may be said to be a test case because it clarifies the law generally on a particular point is not, as this Court has often </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">			ruled, a ground in itself for refusing to award costs to the successful party.  The fact that one of those parties is a public body or the State does not mean that the taxpayer </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">			should be required to carry the burden of being brought before the courts by an unsuccessful claimant in the absence of special circumstances warranting the Court to </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">			exercise its discretion not to apply the general principle that costs follow the event.  As Clarke J. pointed out above the fact that a case is in a substantive way a test case to </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">			which the State is a party is a factor, among others, to be taken into account.  </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		9.	There are, in the view of the Court, special factors in this case.  In recent times a substantive volume of cases have come before the courts which arise out of  sexual assault </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">			and/or abuse of minors by adults, a significant number of which involve teachers whose salary is paid by the State.  Although such cases have come before the courts in </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">			recent times their number reflects the fact that they are the accumulation of claims of wrongdoing extending over the past three or four decades.  In this particular case the </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">			perpetrator involved was a primary school teacher.  The issues concerning the alleged liability of the Minister and the State arose in the context of what are, for historical </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">			reasons, complex relationships between a primary school teacher whose salary is paid by the State, the employer who is the manager of the school, the owner or trustees of </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">			the school, the Minister who has certain administrative and statutory responsibilities concerning the provision of education and the approval of teachers and the State itself </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">			which has a constitutional duty to provide for free primary education.  The historical evolution and complexity of the respective role of and relationships between these parties </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">			were reviewed in the judgments delivered in this case and the issue of vicarious liability fell to be decided in that context.</font><br>
<br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		10.	Given the nature of this case, its relationship with other cases of a similar nature and the context in which the complex issues in the appeal arose, the Court is satisfied that in </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">			all the circumstances there are exceptional reasons why the normal rule of costs following the event should not be followed in this instance.  Those exceptional circumstances </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">			may also be reflected in the fact that counsel for the Minister indicated that a &#8220;sympathetic view&#8221; would be taken with regard to the execution of an order for costs in this </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">			case should one be made in favour of the Minister, although what precisely that meant was not expressly stated.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		11.	In all the circumstances the Court considers that its discretion in this instance should be exercised so as to refuse the State&#8217;s application for costs and accordingly no order </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">			for costs should be made against the appellant in this appeal.  </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		12.	Having regard to the same considerations the Court considers that it should  also set aside the order for costs awarded to the State against the appellant in the High Court </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">			and otherwise make no order for costs in those proceedings between the appellant and the State.</font><br>
