<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Judgment delivered the 19th day of July, 2007 by Denham J. </font></b>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">1.	This is an appeal on an interlocutory matter by P.L. and B.M., the respondents/appellants, hereinafter referred to as 'the respondents', from the judgment and order of the High Court (Abbot J.) of the 23rd March, 2007.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2.	At the heart of this case is an infant, H.L..  J.McD., the applicant/respondent, hereinafter referred to as 'the applicant', is the biological father of the infant, by means of artificial insemination.  The respondents, who are both female, underwent a Civil Union Ceremony in England in January, 2006.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3.	The respondents wished to have a child.  After months of consideration and discussion the applicant agreed to have a child with the first named respondent by means of artificial insemination.  The baby was conceived and the good news was shared with the applicant's family.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">4.	In September, 2005 it was agreed to formalise the arrangement.  There were a number of drafts of an agreement.  Finally an agreement was signed on 11th September, 2005.  The agreement states that it would be in the best interests of the child to know his biological father and that the child would know that the applicant is his father.  It states that the applicant's role will be as a favourite uncle and that he will be welcome to visit the child at times mutually convenient to the parties.  It states that in the event of the first named respondent's death that the applicant's contact with the child would continue uninterrupted, and that in addition his opinion would be sought regarding the best guardianship arrangements for the child.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">5.	The infant was born in May, 2006, taking the applicant's first name as his second name.  In the following months the parties visited each other regularly, the applicant took the infant for walks in his buggy, and the parties had dinner in each others homes.  The applicant provided items to assist with the new arrival.  The applicant offered financial assistance for the birthing, but this was declined.  The applicant also offered to assist with the child's day to day expenses, but this was declined.  The applicant has informed the respondents that he has opened a trust account for the infant, to which he makes monthly lodgements.  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">6.	In September, 2006 the respondents' attitude to the applicant and his role with the infant altered.  They informed him that the parties had become too close and that a greater distance and formality was required.  After this the applicant had only two further contact visits with the infant, one in October, 2006 and one in November, 2006.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	There has been no substantive hearing as yet in this case, thus the facts have yet to be determined.  It was submitted by the applicant that after November, 2006 he was giving the respondents the space they sought.  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7.	On hearing that the respondents were about to embark on a holiday in Australia with the infant, and that they were thinking of relocating there, the applicant brought an action restraining the respondents.  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">8.	The applicant sought and obtained an interim order.  Subsequently, he obtained an interlocutory order, from which the respondents have appealed.  In that interlocutory order the High Court (Abbott J.) ordered:-</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;a.	The first and second named respondents be at liberty to remove the infant H.L. from the jurisdiction of this Court for the purpose of a vacation in Australia from Sunday 25th March, 2007 returning to the jurisdiction of this Court on or before midnight on the 9th day of May, 2007.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">b.	On the return of the child to the jurisdiction that his two passports (Irish and Australian) be lodged with the Registrar of the Family Law List High Court by 4 pm on Monday 14th day of May, 2007. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">c.	On the return of the child to this jurisdiction the applicant, the respondents, their servants and agents, and any persons having notice of the making of the Order, be restrained from thereafter removing the said infant from the jurisdiction of this Court without the leave of this Court pending the determination of these proceedings.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">d.	Liberty to notify:-</font>
<ul><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">i.	the relevant Garda Síochána and Port Authorities, and </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">ii	the relevant Northern Irish Police and Port Authorities,</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">iii	the Australian Embassy.</font></ul>
<br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">e.	The applicant be and he is hereby at liberty to amend the Notice of Motion herein dated the 22nd day of March 2007 so as to include therein a claim for interim access to the said infant H.L. - the said amended Notice of Motion to be served on the solicitors for the respondents by the 20th day of April, 2007. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">f.	The Special Summons herein listed before the Master of this Court on the 18th day of April 2007 be transferred from the Master's List to the Family Law List forthwith.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">g.	The said Special Summons and this Notice of Motion be listed for mention in the Family Law List on Friday the 18th day of May, 2007.&quot;</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	On the 30th March, 2007 the learned High Court judge ordered that a named person be appointed for the purpose of the preparation of a report, pursuant to s.47 of the Family Law Act, 1995, for the court.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">9.	The first named respondent took leave of absence from her employment to become pregnant and take care of the baby.  The respondents planned to visit Australia for a year, from March, 2007 to approximately May, 2008.  The first named respondent is Australian and she wished to give the infant an opportunity to spend time with her family.  Her mother is unwell and unable to visit Ireland.  The second named respondent secured temporary employment in Australia, for the planned year away, and they have let their home in Ireland.  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">10.	The applicant was informed in March, 2007 of the respondents' plans.  On 22nd March, 2007 the applicant instituted proceedings under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964 seeking, </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">inter alia</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, to be appointed guardian of the child and joint custody.  He also sought orders pursuant to the Child Abduction and Enforcement of Custody Orders Act, 1991 and Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  This substantive action has not yet been heard by the High Court.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">11.	Right to apply</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	The applicant has a right to apply to the court.  Under s.6A of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, as amended, it is provided:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;(i)	Where the father and mother of an infant have not married each other, the Court may on the application of the father, by order appoint him to be guardian of the infant.&quot;</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	In </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">J.K. v. V.W</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">. [1990] 2 I.R. 437 this Court held that:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">(i)	s. 6A of the Act of 1964 gave a natural father the right to apply to be appointed guardian but it neither gave him the right to be guardian nor equated his position at law with regard to the infant with the position of a father married to the mother who is and must remain a guardian. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii)	That the court must regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iii)	That the natural father did not have a constitutional right or a natural right identified by the Constitution to guardianship of the child and s. 6A of the Act of 1964 did not declare or acknowledge that right although the blood link between the father and the child and the possibility for the infant to have the benefit of the guardianship and society of its father were one of many factors relevant to its welfare which might be viewed by the court.</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	Finlay C.J. stated:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">	&quot;Section 6A gives a right to the natural father to apply to be appointed guardian.  It does not give him a right to be guardian, and it does not equate his position vis-à-vis the infant as a matter of law with the position of a father who is married to the mother of the infant.  In the latter instance the father is the guardian of the infant and must remain so, although certain of the powers and rights of a guardian may, in the interests of the welfare of the infant, be taken from him. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	The right to apply to be appointed guardian of the infant under s.6A of the Act of 1964 (as inserted by the Act of 1987) is a right to apply pursuant to a statute which specifically provides that the court in deciding upon such application shall regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration.&quot;</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	However, this appeal does not raise the substantive issues.  At issue in this appeal is whether an interlocutory injunction should restrain the infant from leaving the State pending the hearing of the application. 	</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">12.	Issues</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	In fact there are two issues before this Court:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">(a)	The injunction restraining the removal of the infant H.L. from the State.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(b)	The appointment of an assessor pursuant to s.47.</font></ul>
<br>
</ul>
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">13.	Injunction</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	The first issue, therefore, is the interlocutory injunction restraining the removal of the infant H.L. from the State, pending the determination of the proceedings, save for the six week period ending on the 9th May, 2007.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">14.	Test</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	The High Court identified the test to be applied, as follows:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">	&quot;The basis upon which the Court in a case such as this should decide the  case is firstly to decide whether there is a fair question to be tried, or a fair issue to be tried, and then having decided if there is a fair issue to be tried then to consider the balance of convenience &#8230; &#8230; &#8230; and in relation to this particular case as it is a case dealing with an infant, I consider that the balance of convenience test should be tempered to a very large degree by the provisions of s.3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, that in determining a matter in relation to the upbringing etc, of a child and where that is in question the Court shall have regard to the welfare of the child, as the first and paramount consideration&quot;.</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	The learned High Court judge considered the inconvenience to the respondents of unravelling their arrangements to go to Australia, balanced against the interest the infant may have in having contact with the applicant.  The High Court found that there was a bond between the applicant and the child, formed very strongly on the part of the applicant which will be reciprocated imminently by the child.  Also the High Court found that the lack of employment or economic misfortune is not immediately in sight for the respondents, although the second named respondent will suffer grave inconvenience and possible professional embarrassment by being unable to travel to Australia as planned.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	The High Court found:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">	&quot;It would appear to me that the balancing exercise should be swung in favour of the child remaining in the jurisdiction, and within proximity of his father for the purpose of developing the relationship between father and child.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	Notwithstanding the contract, and notwithstanding the mother, the first named respondent is now sole guardian of the child and has her natural constitutional rights and is entitled to custody of the child to the exclusion of all persons, as defined in the Guardianship of Infants Act.  But notwithstanding that I have to consider that there is a fair question to be tried in relation to the issue as to whether the father has a right to be appointed a guardian of the infant too, and I bear in mind that he is not a stranger to the infant, as I said, and indeed the contract itself in some respects, and especially in relation to arrangements on the death of the respondent, is indicative of a fair degree of merit in relation to an application, even though the application results, if it is in favour of the applicant father, would run contrary to the contract&quot;.</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	The High Court then held:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">	&quot;I consider that the loss of a critical year, a year when a bond is about to open up on an objective scale a reciprocal scale between father and son is a period not to be missed if at all possible.  I do not see any serious and irreparable loss on the part of the respondents if they miss this year&quot;.</font></ul>
<br>
</ul>
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">15.	Submissions by respondents</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	It was submitted on behalf of the respondents that the High Court applied a test of balance of convenience tempered by considerations of the welfare of the child, and that in this balancing exercise the potential relationship between the infant and the applicant outweighed all other factors.  It was submitted that the learned trial judge erred in applying such a test.  It was submitted that all the evidence was on affidavit and that this Court is in the same position as the High Court and may substitute its findings of fact.  It was submitted that the High Court erred in holding that the opportunity for the applicant to develop a relationship with the infant outweighed other factors.  The respondents submitted that the proper matters for the Court to take into account in assessing the balance of convenience in a case concerning the removal of an infant from the jurisdiction is:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;(i)	That the welfare of a child, particularly a non-marital child, is best served in the custody of his mother.  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii)	That the first named respondent is the natural mother of the infant possessing a personal constitutional right to the custody of her infant.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iii)	That the natural father does not possess any rights in relation to the infant, and his right consists of a right to apply for access or guardianship.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iv)	That the parties have entered into a written agreement whereby the first and second respondents are acknowledged to be the sole parents of the child, and the applicant is to have no part in the upbringing of the child.  That the applicant's contract with the child is at the sole discretion of the first and second respondents.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(v)	That the first named respondent is the primary carer for the child, and that her proposals for the temporary relocation of the child to Australia were reasonable and proportionate in all the circumstances of the case.</font></ul>
<br>
</ul>
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">16.	Submissions by applicant</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	The applicant submitted that the orders of the High Court should be upheld for the following reasons:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">(i)	The agreement signed by the parties on the 11th September, 2005 was not a valid and binding contract.  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii)	The High Court was entirely correct to take a child-centred approach.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iii)	It was admitted that the applicant does not possess constitutional rights in relation to his son, but he possesses a statutory right to apply to the courts for access and/or joint guardianship.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iv)	There are no reported Irish cases concerning access or guardianship applications of identifiable sperm donors.  However, the Court was referred to case law in other jurisdictions.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(v)	It was submitted that the facts in the case would amount to the 'close personal ties' necessary to engage Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(vi)	The </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Payne</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> decision should not be followed in this jurisdiction, so the 'reasonableness' of the proposed relocation of the respondent does not end the matter.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(vii)	The planned relocation of the respondents cannot be labelled as a temporary relocation. It is a lengthy stay at a critical time in the infant's development.</font></ul>

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">17.	Balance of Convenience</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	On the matter of the injunction, there is a single issue before the Court, the balance of convenience.  It was conceded that there was a fair issue to be tried.  Obviously this is not a case where damages would be an adequate remedy.  Therefore the single issue for the Court is the determination of the balance of convenience on the facts before the Court.  To do this the Court has to weigh the relevant factors.  There is no exhaustive list of relevant factors in assessing the balance of convenience.  The exercise is required to be carried out in the context of all the circumstances of a case.  In this situation the Court seeks to weigh the factors and take the course involving the least risk of injustice.  Thus it is necessary to consider the risk of injustice to the parties.  Where the risk of injustice is evenly balanced then there may be merit in preserving the status quo.  Some cases may have special factors.  In this case a significant factor is the welfare of the infant.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">18.	An infant</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	At the core of this case is the infant, H.L..  His welfare is of paramount importance.  While submissions were made by counsel as to the balance of convenience to the applicant and to the respondents, no counsel was before the Court to make submissions on behalf of the infant.  In a case such as this, I would have found it of great assistance to have the benefit of such a submission.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">19.	Case Law</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	There is no specific statutory law on the issue before the Court, nor any Irish case law.  This case brings novel matters before the Court.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	Counsel referred to cases from other jurisdictions.  None were directly on point.  The Court was referred to the English case of </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">R.M</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">. (Sperm Donor Father) [2003] Fam Law 94, where a lesbian couple had advertised for a man to father a child, saying they were happy for the father to act as a father figure to the child, subject to them being the primary carers; the applicant applied and ultimately a child was born.  After the child was born the couple became concerned that there was too much involvement with the father.  Apart from initial visits after the birth they did not let him have further contact.  He applied for contact and a parental responsibility order.  Black J. made a defined contact order and adjourned the application for parental responsibility.  She held that there was advantage in sharing contact with the father at an early age.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	In </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">X. v. Y</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">. 2002 GWD 12-344 a Scottish case, Sheriff Laura Duncan held in Glasgow Sheriff Court that a homosexual sperm donor had parental rights in relation to a child conceived with his sperm and being brought up by a lesbian couple, including the mother.  In that case it was held that the child had family ties and Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights applied to their relationship, that it was in the best interest of the child that the applicant was involved with decisions as to his education etc.; that it was in the best interest of the child that he have contact with that applicant.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	</font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Re Patrick</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (2002) 28 Fam LR 579 was the first Australian case to deal with the issue of whether a sperm donor has a right of contact with the child under family law.  In that case the facts were of the father as a homosexual sperm donor, a lesbian couple and a two year old child.  While that case was grounded on Australian Family Law it was based on the principle that the welfare of the child is the paramount consideration of a court, and the court ordered contact visits between father and child.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	This Court was referred to conflicting decisions from other jurisdictions on the issue of relocation of a primary carer, with consequent affect on the other parent.  None of these cases are entirely on the point at issue in this case.  Many relate to married couples who subsequently separate.  The factual contexts are not very relevant to this case.  In this case it appears that all parties are bona fide in their motives.  The wish to relocate is temporary - for a year.  However, it does not relate to a significant career enhancing opportunity for the mother, as in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">R A (Temporary Removal from Jurisdiction)</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (2004) EWCA Civ 1587.  The mother's partner has an offer to work for a year in Australia.  The primary motive for the relocation does not appear to be this career move.  Rather, it appears to be because the first named respondent is Australian and she wishes the infant to have contact with her family.  However, contact was achieved in the six week visit to Australia which took place in the Spring of this year.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	All in all, I find none of the case law from other jurisdictions to be of assistance on this interlocutory application, this appeal should be decided on first principles, on the facts.  Consequently, the paramount issue is the welfare of the child.  There is a dearth of fact on that issue, and consequently, the issue is rendered more difficult to decide.  </font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">20.	Factors</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	In considering the balance of convenience in this case, the factors in favour of the respondents include the following:-  the welfare of the infant is best served in the custody of the first named respondent, the mother; the mother has a constitutional right to the custody of her child; the first named respondent is Australian and wishes her child to know her family; the parties have entered into a written agreement; the first named respondent is the primary carer for the child; the respondents propose a temporary relocation to Australia, until June, 2008; this is a reasonable and proportionate plan; the second named respondent is the breadwinner and she has taken leave of absence from her job for a year and a temporary job in Australia until June, 2008; the respondents have let their house in Ireland for the year.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	On the other hand the factors in favour of the applicant include that he is the biological father; he entered into a agreement with the respondents as to the infant (which will be an issue in the substantive case); he has a right to apply to court for access and joint custody; the applicant has applied to the High Court and this application has to be determined; even if, as appears to be accepted, the relocation to Australia is only for a year, this is at a formative age of the infant.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">21.	Welfare of the infant</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	The critical factor in the balancing required of the Court in this case is the welfare of the infant - on which the Court has had no expert assistance.  The Court heard submissions by the parties as to their view of the balance of convenience, but that must be considered as being tinted by their interests. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	The welfare of the infant is of paramount importance.  In the vacuum of information as to the welfare of the child the Court must use the fulcrum of justice in seeking the balance of convenience.  In the circumstances I am satisfied that the welfare of the child must be a weighty factor.  In making this decision I do so with the infant in mind.  Consequently, I would affirm the judgment of the High Court.  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	However, from this decision, that the balance of convenience lies in dismissing the appeal, it should not be inferred as presuming rights for the applicant.  While the applicant has launched his application, those matters have yet to be decided by the High Court.  I make no decision on those matters, and nor should any be presumed from this judgment.  	</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	I am guided by the paramount importance of the welfare of the infant, by the young age of the infant, by the fact that a year is a long time in the life of a developing infant, and by the injustice that would be done to the infant if the applicant is ultimately successful in his application.  </font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">22.	Section 47 Assessor</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	The second issue is the appointment of an assessor pursuant to s.47.  The respondents submitted that this appointment was not in the interest of the welfare of the child; that it is not necessary to address the issue before the High Court decides whether the applicant should have access, and/or guardianship of the infant, and also that such assessment should not be directed prior to the High Court decision on whether the contract entered into between the parties is binding.  On behalf of the applicant it was submitted that it was necessary to observe and monitor the interaction of the infant and the natural father as they get to know one another through successive experiences of contact.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	In the circumstances I am satisfied that the High Court would be assisted by a s.47 report.  It would be relevant to the fundamental issue in the case - the welfare of the child.  Consequently, I would affirm this decision of the High Court also.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">23.	Conclusion</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	For the reasons given I would dismiss the appeal, affirm both interlocutory orders of the High Court, and remit the matter to the High Court so that the application may proceed.  I note that the usual undertaking as to damages was given to the Court by counsel on behalf of the applicant.</font>
