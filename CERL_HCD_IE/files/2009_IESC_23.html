<br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Judgment delivered the 24th day of March, 2009 by Macken, J.</font></b><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	By order of the High Court (McKechnie, J.) made on the 5th day of July 2004 the applicant was granted leave to apply by way of judicial review for, inter alia,  an order in the nature of an injunction restraining the respondent from taking any further steps in a criminal prosecution entitled Circuit Criminal Court County of the City of Dublin Bill No. 192/01; a declaration that a failure on the part of the respondent to obtain and/or preserve relevant evidence in particular the motor vehicle allegedly used in the offences alleged is a breach of the applicant&#8217;s right to a fair trial; a declaration that the applicant was entitled to be informed of the respondent&#8217;s decision and/or intention not to preserve the motor vehicle before it was returned; a declaration that the failure on the part of the respondent to subject the motor vehicle to forensic testing or any other proper examination is a breach of the applicant&#8217;s right to a fair trial; and an order staying the further prosecution of the applicant pending the determination of the proceedings.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The application was heard on the 4th November 2005 pursuant to a Notice of Motion dated 8th July, 2004.  By an Order made on the 9th February 2006, the High Court (Dunne, J.), refused the application for judicial review.  The basis for the refusal is set out in the reserved judgment of the learned High Court judge delivered on the 25th January 2006.  The application was refused on the basis that, whereas the vehicle in the case - already forensically tested by the gardaí and returned to its owner within two days of the events giving rise to the charges - should not have been  returned without notice to the applicant, nevertheless the applicant had failed to establish that the absence of the vehicle or of an opportunity to examine it would or might lead to a real or serious risk of an unfair trial.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	From that judgment and order the applicant has appealed.  As matters have transpired, not all nine grounds of appeal are now relevant.  Insofar as the relevant extant ground of appeal is concerned, it is contended that the learned High Court judge erred in law, </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">inter alia, </font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">by failing to address adequately the appellant&#8217;s claim for an injunction in respect of the charge of criminal damage contrary to s.2 of the Criminal Damage Act 1991, and by failing significantly to distinguish this charge from the burglary charge on the same Bill or to apply the law separately to the criminal damage charge.</font><br>
<u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Background:</font></u><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	According to the Book of Evidence and/or the judgment, a raid took place at premises known as XtraVision on Greenhills Road at Tallaght on 16th March 2003.  It is alleged that a dark green Opel Vectra registration number 99 D 54057 belonging to a Mr Lawlor was used in the course of the raid for the purposes of reversing it into the shutters of the premises in order to gain access to them.  The applicant was charged in relation to the raid with two counts as follows:</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(1)	Burglary contrary to s.12(1)(b) and (3) of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001, and</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(2)	Criminal damage contrary to s.2 of the Criminal Damage Act 1991.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The first of these charges has a maximum penalty of 14 years and the second one a maximum penalty of 10 years.  The criminal damage charge is in respect of the Opel Vectra car.  No criminal damage charge was laid in respect of damage to the premises, there being no dispute but that the premises, including the shutters and a plate glass window, were in fact damaged.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Gardaí went to the premises almost immediately and found one person sitting in the back of the car, a Jason Murtagh who has since pleaded guilty, and it is alleged he made certain admissions, including that two other persons had entered the shop premises.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	According to the affidavit of the appellant&#8217;s solicitor, Ms Bambury, sworn in support of the judicial review application in respect of both charges, the evidence against the appellant is primarily identification evidence, based on the evidence to be given, </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">inter alia, </font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">by Garda Vivienne Saunders, who said that she had entered the premises and noticed two male youths behind the counter, whom she described.  She indicated that they fled through a hatch in a connecting door behind the counter of the shop but that she was unable to gain access to that part of the shop to search for them.  She found two youths hiding under some bushes, at an adjoining site on the same industrial estate, and according to her statement in the Book of Evidence, she recognised them as being the same two men she had seen moments earlier behind the counter of the XtraVision store.  She described them as being red-faced, sweating and breathing heavily.  The appellant, she said, was arrested by her colleague Garda Woulfe, and when the garda asked him if he knew why, the appellant replied &#8220;I know I know&#8221;. During interview while in custody the appellant made no admissions.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	A forensic examination was carried out of the vehicle.  This however was only disclosed during the High Court proceedings.  It seems clear from the High Court judgment that the prosecution confirmed that it would be relying on forensic evidence to link the appellant to the driver&#8217;s seat of the Opel Vectra used in the raid.  The vehicle, having been examined, was returned to its owner about two days later, on the 18th March 2003.  It was accepted on behalf of the respondent in the course of the High Court proceedings that the appellant should have been notified of the intention of the gardaí to return the vehicle.</font><br>
<u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The Argument:</font></u><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Before proceeding further it is appropriate to note that senior counsel Mr Collins on behalf of the appellant acknowledged in the course of the oral hearing on this appeal, that the grounds of appeal relating to the burglary charge were not readily capable of being seriously sustained in light of the learned trial judge&#8217;s judgment and he correctly and fairly did not press the court on that element of the appeal.  That left, in effect, only the criminal damage charge as the subject of an extant appeal, and the refusal of the learned High Court judge to prohibit the appellant&#8217;s trial on this charge.  The respondent in the High Court alleged delay by the appellant in commencing the High Court proceedings, and a considerable part of the judgment under appeal concerns the issue of delay, which has been maintained by the respondent in this appeal.  It will be dealt with, where necessary, in the particular context set out below.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Concerning the criminal damage charge, counsel for the appellant submits that he is entitled to succeed in the appeal by reason of the following:  (a)  the learned High Court judge gave no, or no proper, consideration to the application for an order of prohibition so far as concerns the count of criminal damage;  (b)  she gave no reasons or no sufficient reasons for rejecting the application;  (c) the gardaí had failed to retain and preserve the motor vehicle so as to enable the appellant carry out appropriate tests for the purposes of defending the criminal damage charge, thereby depriving him of critical and material evidence from which it might be possible to establish his innocence; and (d) the only way in which the existence of any damage to the motor car could be established at trial, was by prior inspection on behalf of the appellant before it was returned to its owner.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Counsel for the appellant also points to the total absence, in the Book of Evidence, or on affidavit, of any reference at all to damage to the car but only of damage to the premises, and suggests that the charge based on criminal damage to the car may well have been laid in error.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	According to the respondent&#8217;s written submissions, insofar as the criminal damage charge is concerned, apart from the forensic evidence (taken from the car) there is no direct evidence linking the applicant with the car.  The eye witness evidence of the gardaí, if accepted by the jury, it is said, puts the applicant in the XtraVision store, but it is not part of the prosecution case that the gardaí observed the applicant in the car at any time.  In the written submissions, it is also stated that &#8220;contrary to the applicant&#8217;s assertion (in both his judicial review papers and his written submissions) there is evidence that the Opel Vectra used in the raid was damaged.  The rear driver&#8217;s side light cluster came away from the vehicle.  That is consistent with the car having been reversed into the shutters of the XtraVision (shop), causing extensive damage to the shop&#8221;.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In oral argument the respondent meets this case on the following basis: (a) there is evidence, as is clear from the affidavit of Sergeant Woulfe, that part of a lens and the cluster light came from the Opel Vectra; (b) this damage is also clearly implied on a proper reading of the statement of evidence of its owner, Mr Fintan Lawlor; and (c) there will be further evidence in relation to the criminal damage charge, having regard to the affidavit of Garda Sergeant Woulfe, at paragraph 10 of whose affidavit sworn on the 2nd December 2004 he avers:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	&#8220;</font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">I beg to refer to the affidavit of Yvonne Bambury, the applicant&#8217;s solicitor sworn herein on the 5th July 2004.  At paragraph 6 thereof it is suggested that there does not appear to be anything in the book of evidence suggesting that the Opel Vectra used in this burglary was damaged in any way.  That contention is apt to mislead.  The car in question was damaged as it was reversed into the shutters of XtraVision, thereby allowing the offenders to gain entry.  The injured party, Mr Fintan Lawlor, makes an implied mention of the damage in his statement, where he says at page 6 of the book of evidence that &#8220;there was no damage to the car up to when it was stolen on me&#8221;.  </font></i><i><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Evidence as to damage caused will be tendered as part of the prosecution case, including the photographs of which mention has already been made</font></u></i><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">.&#8221; </font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(emphasis added)</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The photograph is referred to in paragraph 4 of Garda Woulfe&#8217;s affidavit which is in the following terms:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	&#8220;</font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">I say that the stolen car used in the incident motor car registration number 99 D 54057, was returned to its rightful owner on the 18th March 2003.  A photograph was taken of the car with the owner as well as of the owner with the car keys.   I say that procedure is in line with standard Garda procedures as outlined in the Garda Code.&#8221;</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Before expressing my conclusions on the above, according to the affidavits exchanged, a photograph was furnished to Ms Bambury which she averred was &#8220;black&#8221;, by which I assume it does not show anything.  That averment has not been denied.  </font><br>
<u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The State of the Evidence:</font></u><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	As matters stand at present, from the Book of Evidence and the affidavits filed, it is difficult to see any real basis for the criminal damage charge against the applicant.  There is little if anything, to support the case that the car was damaged.  The appellant cannot know at this time the case to be made against him and the evidence which will be adduced, in the absence of anything being described by or produced to the court by Garda Woulfe, who swears to its existence and/or intended use..  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Indeed what can be said about the evidence is the following:  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	There is no direct evidence that the car was damaged.  According to the Book of Evidence, the owner of the car has made no statement that it was damaged when he received it back from the Gardaí.  The most he says is that it was not damaged up to the time it was stolen.  Significantly he refers in his statement of evidence to several items as missing from the car but makes no reference whatsoever of any specific damage to the car itself, whether lens damage or light cluster damage or otherwise.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Garda Burke, who does not aver to witnessing the actual raid, according to the Book of Evidence, states &#8220;this vehicle had reversed into the shutters of XtraVision, causing extensive damage to the security shutters, frame and windows of this premises&#8221;.  Nothing is said about damage to the car, however.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Garda Meagher according to the Book of Evidence states &#8220;there was broken glass around the car&#8221;, but without specifying whether this was from the XtraVision plate glass window which, on other evidence, was broken, or from the car, or from some other source.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Again, according to the Book of Evidence, Garda Woulfe refers to seeing &#8220;damage to shutters and the glass of the XtraVision&#8221;.  Garda Woulfe also said that a photograph was taken of the car.  He does not exhibit this and Ms. Bambury has been furnished with a &#8220;black&#8221; photograph.  He says nothing about damage to the car.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">According to the Book of Evidence, Garda Saunders states that &#8220;I received the following exhibits from Detective Garda Damien Scanlon, the rear driver&#8217;s side light cluster from 99 D 54047 in a garda evidence bag, I labelled it VS14.  A sample of lens from 99 D 54057 in a garda evidence bag, I labelled it VS15&#8221;.   No statement of Garda Scanlon is included in the Book of Evidence. </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	There is no evidence at present connecting the lens referred to as exhibit VS15 or the rear light cluster referred to as exhibit VS14, to the car itself.  There is no evidence as to where the lens or the cluster light or either of them was found, or the circumstances in which they were found, or anything otherwise to connect them to the car, other than the assertion by Garda Woulfe, in his affidavit, to that effect. While the above exhibit numbers were given by Garda Saunders to the items in question, Ms. Bambury avers that neither above exhibit appears on the Exhibit Sheet in the Book of Evidence.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	In the course of the garda interview with the appellant no question was put to him concerning damage to the car but only concerning possible damage to the shutters and the glass of the of XtraVision shop.  Counsel drew attention to a question put to the appellant in the following terms: &#8220;you rammed the shutters causing damage to the premises so you could enter and steal from it isn&#8217;t that correct&#8221;.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	From the foregoing it is clear that, even taken at its highest, there is no evidence that the car in question was damaged, nor any evidence that if it was damaged, the damage was caused while the car was at the XtraVision shop, or damaged in the manner suggested.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	However, it is said by Detective Sergeant Woulfe on affidavit that, although the raid took place on the 16th March 2003 and the applicant was charged (or more correctly recharged) in December 2004 that &#8220;further evidence&#8221; will be added to the case against the applicant.  That further evidence is not identified, described or produced, and the only further evidence which is mentioned specifically is the photograph.  The court is left therefore with no idea of the nature or likely value of any such further evidence.</font><br>
<u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Conclusion:</font></u><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	In light of the foregoing, it is scarcely necessary to consider in any great detail the ample case law which has been referred to both by the applicant and by the respondent, much of which is no longer relevant given the concession made by the appellant on the more serious charge of burglary.  That case law makes it clear that where forensic inspection takes place at a time when no one is suspected it would be unreasonable to hold onto a vehicle indefinitely (see </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Scully v DPP, </font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">unreported, the Supreme Court, 16 March 2005).  That is not the position here, because the applicant was charged immediately and recharged later.   However the very short period of time which elapsed between the events in question on the 16th March and the return of the vehicle on the 18th March 2003 indicates clearly that the appellant was neither notified, as is conceded, of the intention to return the vehicle, nor did he have an opportunity of examining the vehicle.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">A further factor of relevance in the present appeal is that it was only in the course of the exchange of pleadings in this judicial review application that the respondent revealed that any forensic testing had been undertaken, not in relation to damage to the car itself, but in relation to placing the applicant both at the premises and in the motor car itself.  In these circumstances, it seems to me that the alleged delay on the part of the appellant in commencing judicial review proceedings cannot prevail over the absence of any evidence and the return of the car without notice to him.  The above  forensic evidence, even if now known to exist, does not appear in any event to advance the prosecution case in any material respect insofar as the criminal damage charge is concerned.  Nor is it of assistance to the appellant in the defence of that charge.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The applicant relies, in particular having regard to its somewhat similar circumstances, on the case of </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Murphy v DPP (1989) ILRM 79.  </font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">That was a case where the applicant had been charged with stealing a car and with certain driving offences.  The car was in the possession of the gardaí and the applicant&#8217;s solicitor had indicated a wish to have the car examined and tested specifically for finger print evidence, but the gardaí parted with the car without either examining it forensically themselves or notifying the applicant&#8217;s solicitor that they intended to part with it.  In the High Court (Lynch, J.) it was stated:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	</font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;It may well be that nothing would have been discovered by the requested forensic inspection, but the applicant has been deprived of the reasonable possibility of rebutting the evidence preferred against him.  It is also clear that there is no way in which this loss to the applicant of possibly corroborative evidence can now be remedied by a further inspection of the car.&#8221;</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Clearly that case dealt with slightly different circumstances in that there had been no forensic examination of the car at all, whereas in the present case there has been forensic examination of the car, but according to the Book of Evidence, no technical examination of the car linking any physical evidence, such as the cluster light, to the car, still less to the criminal damage alleged.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	While it was accepted by the respondent in the High Court that the applicant&#8217;s solicitor ought to have been notified of the intention to return the car to its owner, the principles setting out the parameters surrounding the return of a physical piece of evidence, such as a car, are very well exposed in the judgment of McCracken, J., in  </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">McKeown v Judges of Circuit Court</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> (unreported Supreme Court, 9 April, 2003), in which he stated:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	</font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;If a person is accused of driving a stolen motor car, quite clearly that car is often a vital piece of evidence.  </font></i><i><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">If the car could provide potential evidence favourable to the defence</font></u></i><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> it should certainly be made available to the accused person or his advisors where reasonably practicable before being returned to the owner.  Regard must be had to the practicalities, and in particular to the rights of the unfortunate owner of a stolen car who obviously is entitled to have it returned to him as quickly as possible.  These practicalities must be judged on the facts of each case.  Having regard to the authorities cited the proper procedure would seem to be that if evidence of this nature is to be returned to its true owner, where practicable that should only be done after notice has been given to the accused of the intention to return the evidence and a reasonable time given for the accused or his advisors either to examine the evidence or to dispense with the examination.&#8221; </font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(emphasis added)</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		Obviously, a car which has been stolen must be returned to its owner as soon as this may reasonably be done after examination.  From the Book of Evidence, it is clear that the name of the appellant&#8217;s legal representative, to whom he spoke, was mentioned in the course of the interviews with the appellant.  The gardaí were, therefore, well aware that the appellant&#8217;s solicitors could be readily contacted, and it would, prima facie, have been practicable both to notify the solicitor and to offer a reasonable period of time within which to permit examination or allow the appellant forego that right of examination.  Neither occurred in the present case.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		Without prejudging any possible outcome of the prosecution on the burglary charge, the only evidence which might have been available to support the criminal damage charge is the car itself, given the absence of any evidence connecting the lens or the cluster light to the car or to any damage to it.  Here the appellant&#8217;s case is based on the difference between the evidence, such as it is, but even taken at its highest according to the Book of Evidence, and the evidence which would or might have been available to him had the car been retained for a reasonable period of time so as to facilitate inspection.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		I am satisfied that the appellant was entitled in law to have access to the car for inspection in support of his defence, and that in its absence, the trial on that count could not be held, at this remove, without there being a real and serious risk of an unfair trial. The applicant has not had an opportunity of examining the vehicle and the only manner in which a defence to the criminal damage charge could be advanced is if the car had been retained, or at least examined vis a vis the alleged criminal damage charge, and evidence of this was available.  At present there is no such evidence and no method by which the applicant could engage with the prosecution case on the criminal damage charge.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">I am also satisfied that the prosecution evidence as it stands at present, taken at its highest is such that a jury properly directed could not, in any event,  properly convict the appellant on the criminal damage charge.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		Having regard to the foregoing, the learned trial judge erred in law in not considering to a sufficient extent this aspect of the appellant&#8217;s application, undoubtedly because even on appeal, until the concession was made by counsel on behalf of the appellant, the vast bulk of written submissions in this court, not surprisingly, concentrated on the more serious burglary charge, the forensic examination of the car and the evidential nature of materials supporting that charge as well as the presence of the applicant and others at the actual premises which had been raided, rather than on the criminal damage charge to the motor car.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The appellant is entitled to succeed on his appeal insofar as the criminal damage charge is concerned.  In the circumstances I would allow the appeal but limited to that charge only.  I will therefore set aside the order of the High Court so far as concerns the criminal damage charge, and make an order prohibiting the respondent from taking any further steps on Count 2 in the criminal prosecution entitled Circuit Criminal Court County of the City of Dublin, Bill No. 192/01.</font>
