<b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">JUDGMENT of Mr. Justice Fennelly delivered the 6th day of May 2008</font></u></b><br>
<br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">1. 	</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The court has delivered judgment rejecting the appeal of the above-name appellants who, together with one Mohammed Iqbal, contested the validity, having regard to the Constitution, of the European Arrest Warrant Act, 2003. In this judgment I consider independent complaints made by the two appellants concerned in these appeals, which do not relate to the constitutional validity of the Act.</font><br>
<br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">2.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	On 10th July 2006 European Arrest Warrants were issued by the Regional Court in Prague, a judicial authority in the Czech Republic, in respect of Tomá&#353; </font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman CE">Pùta</font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> (the &#8220;first appellant&#8221;) and Maro&#353; Sulej (the &#8220;second appellant&#8221;). The first appellant is sought in respect of seven and the second appellant in respect of four charges of robbery and theft. All the offences are alleged to have been committed in the Czech Republic in 2000 and 2001. The first appellant is a citizen of the Czech Republic. The second appellant is a citizen of the Slovak Republic. </font><br>
<br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">3.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Each warrant was duly endorsed for execution by the High Court on 14th July 2006; the appellants were arrested on 25th August 2006; they were brought before the High Court (Peart J). Each filed Points of Objection and a number of supporting affidavits. Having heard appropriate evidence on formal matters such as identity, the learned High Court judge was satisfied that, subject the issues that had been raised in relation to fundamental rights under Part III of the Act of 2003, he was required to make the order sought in respect of each of the appellants.</font><br>
<br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">4.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The appellants advanced a number of grounds of objection to their surrender at the hearing in the High Court. Only three of these have been pursued on the appeal, namely:</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">1.	The law implementing the European Arrest Warrant in the Czech Republic as from 1st January 2005 purports to apply retrospectively insofar as the appellants are concerned. Their offences are alleged to have been committed in 2000 and 2001. Czech law does not permit the surrender from the Czech Republic of Czech citizens to other European Union countries in respect of offences committed prior to 1st January 2005. This, it was argued, constitutes discrimination contrary to Czech Constitutional principles. Hence, the European Arrest Warrant was not duly issued for the purposes of section 10 of the Act of 2003.</font>
<ul></ul>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">2.	The appellants, according to their affidavits, believe the Czech Republic to be deeply corrupt. They worry for their safety, if returned. They will not have a fair trial, </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">inter alia, </font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">because of widespread prejudicial publicity. To return them, in these circumstances, would be contrary to section 37 of the Act of 2003.</font>
<ul></ul>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">3.	They say, based on the evidence given by a Czech official on a bail application in the High Court, that they will, if they are surrendered to the Czech Republic, be prosecuted or imprisoned in respect of offences other than those covered by the European Arrest warrants, in breach of sections 22 to 24 of the Act of 2003.</font>
<ul></ul>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">5.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Peart J rejected each of these grounds of objection and made an order in the case of each appellant for his surrender to the Czech Republic pursuant to section 16(1) of the Act of 2003.</font><br>
<br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The appeal</font></b><br>
<br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">6.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The appellants have brought appeals against the decision of the High Court in respect of the above three grounds.</font><br>
<br>
<u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The first ground: the warrants were not duly issued</font></u><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Evidence of Czech law was placed before the High Court in each case. Each of the appellants relied on affidavit evidence from a person apparently qualified to practice law in the Czech Republic. The Minister&#8217;s written submissions complain that the document produced in the case of the second appellant appears to be an unsworn document. Nevertheless, for what it is worth it seems to identify a simple legal contention.</font><br>
<br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">7.	</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Stripped down to its essentials, the point made relates to an alleged difference of treatment of the appellants compared with the treatment, under the rules governing </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">the surrender of persons </font><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">from</font></u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> the Czech Republic to other Member States, of Czech citizens. I confess that it is extremely difficult to be precise about the nature of the legal point, due partly to imperfections in the translated documents before the Court. It is said that </font><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">citizens</font></u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> of the Czech Republic may not be surrendered pursuant to a European Arrest Warrant to another Member State in respect of offences alleged to have been committed before1st January 2005. On the other hand the Czech Republic may seek the surrender from other Member States of persons (including citizens) who are sought in respect of offences alleged to have been committed before 1st January 2005. This difference of treatment is said to have come about as a result of Law No 253/2006 modifying the effect of the European Arrest Warrant, as effected by Law 539/2004 Sb. That law had amended the Penal Code with effect from 1st January 2005. An affidavit of Czech law, from Mr Jaroslav Ortman, a lawyer who has acted for the first appellant in a number of criminal proceedings was produced on his behalf in the High Court. Mr Ortman invokes what he calls &#8220;the constitutional principle of equality.&#8221; Similar affidavit material has been submitted on behalf of the second appellant. Both appellant says that they are considering a constitutional complaint on behalf of the first appellant, which, if successful, according to Mr Ortman, &#8220;would have significant importance to the proceedings against the first appellant.&#8221; Documents have been submitted suggesting that an application has been made to the Czech Constitutional Court at Brno. No decision of that Court has been produced.</font><br>
<br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">8.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Dr Michael Forde, Senior Counsel, argued for the appellants that the obligation of the courts to order the surrender of persons subject to European Arrest Warrants applies only when, as section 10 of the Act of 2003 provides, </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;a judicial authority in an issuing state </font></i><i><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">duly issues</font></u></i><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> a European arrest warrant&#8230;&#8221; </font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(emphasis added). Counsel for the Minister draws attention to section 4A of the Act, inserted by section 69 of the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005, provides:</font><br>

<ul>
<ul><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;</font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">It shall be presumed that an issuing state will comply with the requirements of the Framework Decision, unless the contrary is shown.&#8221;</font></i><br>
<br>
<br>
</ul>
</ul>
<u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Consideration of this point</font></u><br>
<br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">9.	</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">I will assume, for the purposes of the argument, that it would be contrary to the provisions of the Framework Decision if a Member State were to issue a warrant contrary to the terms of its own law and constitution. The presumption enjoined by section 4A reflects the principle of mutual recognition upon which the entire Framework Decision is based. Article 1(1) of the Framework Decision states that: </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;The European arrest warrant is a judicial decision issued by a Member State&#8230;&#8221; </font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The burden is upon the appellants to show that the decision of the Regional Court of Prague to issue the arrest warrant was contrary to the law of the Czech Republic. That decision has not been set aside by any other judicial authority in the Czech Republic. Neither of the affidavits upon which the appellants rely alleges that the decision of the Prague Court was invalid or unlawful. At most, they evince an intention to make a complaint to the Constitutional Court. </font><br>
<br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">10.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	This ground of appeal is, in my view, entirely unsustainable. The appellants wish this Court to rule that the provisions of Czech law which implement the European arrest warrant are contrary to Czech constitutional principles.  This Court could not conceivably pass judgment on the validity of existing Czech legal provisions. That is patently exclusively a matter for the domestic legal system.</font><br>
<br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">11.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	In these circumstances, it is not appropriate to express any view about whether the distinction identified by the appellants could amount to discrimination.  </font><br>
<br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">12.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	I would dismiss this ground of appeal.</font><br>
<br>
<u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Infringement of fundamental rights; fair trial</font></u><br>
<br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">13.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The appellants have made wide-ranging charges against the Czech Republic, amounting, in effect, to a contention that that Member State is, in reality, not fit to be a member of the European Union. In doing so, they invoke section 37 of the Act of 2003, which provides:</font><br>

<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">15.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The first appellant has sworn: </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;I am worried for my safety. I believe I will be killed or seriously harmed if returned to the Czech Republic and I believe I cannot get a fair trial.&#8221; </font></i><br>
<br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">16.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The second appellant has sworn: </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;I am worried for my safety. I believe I will be tortured, seriously harmed or killed if returned to the Czech Republic. I believe I cannot be protected or get a fair trial.&#8221; </font></i><br>
<br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">17.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	It scarcely needs to be said that our courts would not surrender anybody to a Member State where he or she was likely to be subjected to treatment such as is alleged to be feared in these statements. The thirteenth recital to the Framework Decision, which is reflected by section 37 of the Act of 2003, says:</font><br>

<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;No person should be removed, expelled or extradited to a State where there is a serious risk that he or she would be subjected to the death penalty, torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221;</font></i><br>
</ul>
</ul>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">18.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The question then arises as to the quality or standard of proof which the courts of the executing state should require to satisfy it that the person whose surrender is sought faces such a </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">serious risk. </font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> In the present case, the appellants&#8217; surrender is sought to face trial on serious criminal charges. </font><br>
<br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">19.	</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In their affidavits, they attempt to mount an attack on the root and the branch of the police, legal and governmental system of the Czech Republic. The first </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">appellant queries whether the Czech Republic is acceptable to be a member of the EU. He says: </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;The Czech Republic is more like the Wild West and those in charge are more like the Italian mafia.&#8221; </font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> The balance of his affidavit contains a large number of largely incomprehensible allegations of corruption and violence (including murder) against, on the whole, unnamed persons. The second appellant largely supports the allegations of the first appellant. He says he has no faith in the justice system of the Czech Republic. In particular, he lists fourteen people described as: &#8220;people who knew a lot about corruption in the police and justice system&#8230;&#8230;or who wanted to speak out about it [who] have either been killed or have died in suspicious circumstances.&#8221; </font><br>
<br>
<u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Consideration of this ground</font></u><br>
<br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">20.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The appellants have produced no independent evidence in support of what amounts to an invitation to this Court to condemn the Czech system of justice as fundamentally unjust, corrupt and incapable of providing a fair trial. The first appellant has sworn a lengthy affidavit full of unsubstantiated allegations of mistreatment of members of his family and others. </font><br>
<br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">21.	</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">I am satisfied that this Court simply cannot act on foot of affidavits which have all the appearance of wild and irresponsible allegations. It has to take judicial notice of the principle of mutual recognition. Membership of the European Union imposes on each and every Member State the obligation to respect fundamental human rights. As a consequence, each Member State owes it to each other to presume, unless the contrary is clearly shown, that it will respect those rights both as they reside in its own citizens and in the citizens of the other Member States.    </font><br>
<br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">22.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The Minister has drawn attention to the tenth recital to the Framework Decision which is in the following terms:</font><br>

<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The mechanism of the European arrest warrant is based on a high level of confidence between Member States. Its implementation may be suspended only in the event of a serious and persistent breach by one of the Member States of   the principle set out in Article 6 (1) of the Treaty on European Union, determined by the Council pursuant to Article 7 (1) of the said Treaty with the consequences set out in Article 7 (2) thereof</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">.</font></ul>
</ul>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">23.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union provides:</font><br>

<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">1.	The Union is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law, principles which are common to the Member States.</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">2. 	The Union shall respect fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms signed in Rome on 4 November 1950 and as they result from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, as general principles of Community law.</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">24.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Article 7 of that Treaty sets out an elaborate mechanism, implicating the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, and potentially leading to a determination that </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;there is a clear risk of a serious breach by a Member State of principles mentioned in Article 6(1)&#8230;&#8221;</font></i><br>
<br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">25.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	If respect for fundamental human rights in the Czech Republic were so at odds with the obligations incumbent on that Member State pursuant to Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, the procedures provided by Article 7 of that Treaty would have to be set in train. The appellants make allegations of a highly generalized character, but they produce no evidence relevant to their own cases. In my view, it is not open to the courts of a single Member State to decide that issue, at least without clear independent evidence. </font><br>
<br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">26.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	It is, of course, clear that persons in the position of the appellants are entitled to resist the making of the order by producing proof that they face the risk of mistreatment on their return. That is clear from the recitals to the Framework Decision and from section 37 of the Act of 2003. But they must discharge a heavy onus. They must rebut the presumption that the issuing state generally respects human rights. The evidence must be cogent. That is that it must be coherent and persuasive. It is easy to</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">make unsupported and unverifiable assertions about the state of affairs in another country.</font><br>
<br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">27.	</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">I am satisfied that the affidavit evidence produced in this case falls far short of discharging the burden resting on the appellants. I would dismiss the ground of appeal.</font><br>
<br>
<u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The third ground: Specialty</font></u><br>
<br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">28.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Section 22(2) of the Act of 2003, as amended by the Act of 2005 provides:</font><br>

<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;Subject to this section, the High Court shall refuse to surrender a person under this Act if it is satisfied that&#8212;</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> </font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">  (a) the law of the issuing state does not provide that a person who is surrendered to it pursuant to a European arrest warrant shall not be proceeded against, sentenced or detained for the purposes of executing a sentence or detention order, or otherwise restricted in his or her personal liberty, in respect of an offence, and</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> </font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">  (b) the person will be proceeded against, sentenced, or detained for the purposes of executing a sentence or detention order, or otherwise restricted in his or her personal liberty, in respect of an offence.&#8221;</font></i><br>
</ul>
</ul>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">29.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The term </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;offence&#8221; </font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">is defined in subsection (1) as being an offence (other than the offence in respect of which the surrender is sought) committed before the surrender.</font><br>
<br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">30.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Sub-section (3) provides for a presumption in the following terms:</font><br>

<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;It shall be presumed that, in relation to a person to whom a European arrest warrant applies, the issuing state does not intend to&#8212;</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> </font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">  (a) proceed against him or her,</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> </font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">  (b) sentence or detain him or her for a purpose referred to in subsection (2)(a), or</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> </font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">  (c) otherwise restrict him or her in his or her personal liberty,</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> </font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">  in respect of an offence, unless the contrary is proved.&#8221;</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">31.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	It follows from these provisions that the appellants must satisfy the Court, in the event of their being surrendered, of two matters, namely:</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Symbol">·	</font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">That the law of the Czech Republic does not provide that they will not be proceeded against, sentenced or detained in respect of matters other than those for which they have been surrendered;</font>
<ul></ul>
<font size="4" face="Symbol">·	</font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">That they will, in fact, be proceeded against, sentenced or detained in respect of such other matters.</font><br>
<br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">32.	</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Both appellants rely on evidence given by one Major Gregor from the Czech Republic at High Court bail hearings.  That witness gave evidence that the first appellant had been convicted in his absence of an offence and sentenced in December 2005 to two years imprisonment. In addition, he was suspected in the Czech Republic of other offences including murder. This evidence appears, incidentally to be confirmed by Mr Ortman, mentioned above, who mentions having acted for the first appellant in criminal cases where sentences of imprisonment were imposed.  </font><br>
<br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">33.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	In the case of the second appellant, the evidence of Major Grigor was that there are </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;other matters where Mr. Sulej is suspect are being investigated&#8230;&#8221; </font></i><br>
<br>
<br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">34.	</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">It can be assumed, therefore, that there are outstanding criminal matters, in respect of which the appellants might be the subject of investigation and consequential prosecution in the Czech Republic. The first appellant seems to have</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">been convicted and sentenced to a term or terms of imprisonment, though it is unclear whether any of those sentences have been served. </font><br>
<br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">35.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	However, section 22 imposes the burden of proof on the appellants to establish the legal situation in the Czech Republic and the fact that they will be prosecuted for other offences.</font><br>
<br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">36.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The key and more important point is that section 22 reflects the provisions of Article 27 of the Framework Decision. Paragraph 2 of that Article provides that, subject to exceptions which are not relevant and which are also reflected in section 22:</font><br>

<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;Except in the cases referred to in paragraphs 1 and 3, a person surrendered may not be prosecuted, sentenced or otherwise deprived of his or her liberty for an offence committed prior to his or her surrender other than that for which he or she was surrendered.&#8221;</font></i><br>
</ul>
</ul>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">37.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The appellants have not suggested that this aspect of the Framework Decision has not been implemented in Czech law. This Court must presume, until the contrary is proved, that it has. Section 4A of the Act of 2003, as amended in 2005, provides:</font>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;It shall be presumed that an issuing state will comply with the requirements of the Framework Decision, unless the contrary is shown.&#8221;</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">38.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	It should be clearly stated that the Framework Decision prohibits the prosecution or imprisonment of persons surrendered in respect of matters committed prior to their surrender other than the charges for which they have been surrendered. The Czech Republic would be acting in breach of its obligations under the Framework Decision, if it were to prosecute or otherwise pursue either of the appellants in respect </font><br>
<br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">of such matters other than the offences specified in the warrant. However, the appellants have not shown that this will happen.</font>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">39.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	I would dismiss this ground of appeal.</font>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">40.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Accordingly, for the reasons given, I would dismiss the appeal of each of the appellants and affirm the order of the High Court. </font>
