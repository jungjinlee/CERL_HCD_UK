<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">1.	This is an appeal by Ludmilla Borisovna Pratkunas, the respondent/appellant, &quot;the appellant&quot;, from the judgment of the High Court (Peart J.) delivered on the 28th November, 2007, and from the order committing the appellant to prison pending her surrender to the Russian Federation, in accordance with Part II of the Extradition Act, 1965.  On the appellant lodging a notice of appeal the High Court granted bail pending the hearing of this appeal.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">2.	The appellant is a national of Estonia who is sought by the Russian Federation under the Extradition Act, 1965.  The request is dated the 31st March, 2006.  A warrant of arrest was issued by the High Court on the 25th April, 2006, and the appellant was arrested on the 26th June, 2006.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">3.	The appellant returned to Estonia from Russia on the 20th November, 2000.  In June, 2001 she moved to Ireland with her husband.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">4.	The appellant is sought for the purpose of being charged with an alleged offence of fraud.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">5.	The allegation is that the appellant and an accomplice, a Mr. Vaganov, had, through a company Mirage Limited, signed a contract on the 24th March, 2000, agreeing to repay a debt owed </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">by the Reft Hydroelectric Station to the State's &quot;Sverdlovgosenergonadzor&quot; in the amount of 200,000 roubles.  It appears that in return for discharging the debts of the Hydroelectric Station the </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">agreement was that certain products to the value of 200,000 roubles would be transferred to the company.  It is alleged that pursuant to this agreement Mirage Limited received a certificate in June, </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">2000 to the effect that the money had been transferred and that the appellant and Mr. Vaganov used this certificate to receive concrete slabs to the value of 381,866 roubles between the 30th </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">August, 2000 and the 31st December, 2000.  The Russian Federation alleges that the company did not discharge the debt as agreed and that the appellant and Mr. Vaganov misappropriated the </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">concrete blocks they had received.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">6.	An investigation was commenced in April, 2002 and charges were preferred in June, 2002.  Mr. Vaganov was found guilty in October, 2002 and was given a five year suspended sentence </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">on condition that he repay the money.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">7.	The appellant has deposed that in about October, 2000 she was detained by the Russian authorities.  It transpired that this was not related to the charge now in issue, but that she was </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">detained for failing to register as a foreign national within three days of her arrival in the country.  She averred that while in police custody she was subjected to degrading treatment and to physical </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">and verbal abuse.  She stated that her apartment was ransacked and documents relevant to the matter the subject of the warrant in this case were taken.  She stated that she tried to complain about </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">this to the police but was told that if she did not return to Estonia within six hours her family would never see her again.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">8.	</font><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The High Court</font></u></b><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The learned High Court judge pointed out that there was no objection by the appellant to the documents or other matters referred to in s.29 of the Extradition Act, 1965 and he was satisfied the section had been complied with.  The High Court was also satisfied that the offence was a corresponding offence.  Subject to issues raised by the appellant, the learned High Court judge was satisfied that all of the requirements of the Extradition Act, 1965 have been complied with and that the extradition of the appellant should be ordered.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">9.	The issues raised by appellant in the High Court included:-</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	(i)	documentation;</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	(ii)	inhuman and degrading treatment;</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	(iii)	protection of constitutional rights; and</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	(iv)	the right to a fair trial.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Also, addressed by the learned trial judge, there was a comparison drawn between extraditions pursuant to Part II of the Extradition Act, 1965 and the European Arrest Warrant Act system.	</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">10.	</font><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Documentation</font></u></b><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The appellant submitted that the terms of s.37 of the Extradition Act, 1965 do not apply to documents furnished to the Court in response to issues raised by the appellant.  The appellants had raised issues as to her treatment when she was arrested in 2000 in Russia.  The requesting state rejected her allegations and provided copies of reports prepared at the time of her arrest and detention, and a statement that no complaint was made at that time.  Counsel for the appellant submitted that the High Court ought not to have had regard to the documents as they had not been exhibited by the relevant person in the requesting state in an affidavit.  It was submitted that s.37 of the Extradition Act, 1965 did not apply to these documents, that s.37 applies only to documents referred to in s.25 of the Extradition Act, 1965.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">11.	</font><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The High Court</font></u></b><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The learned High Court judge held:-</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	&quot;On this point I am not satisfied that s. 37 operates so as to prevent this Court from having regard to these reports where they are provided by the requesting authority in order to deal with allegations made by the respondent following the Request having been made. It is by now trite law to state that extradition proceedings are &#8216;</font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">sui generis</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8217; in nature, and that there are not adversarial proceedings where the very strict applications of the laws of evidence must be adhered to, such as in a criminal trial. Counsel has submitted that where the onus of proof is on the respondent to stand up her allegations of mistreatment, it is impossible to meet the rejection of her allegations unless the countervailing facts are sworn to so that the deponent can be cross-examined and the evidence tested in the usual way. However, there is no reality in that situation arising in this situation. Perhaps some official in the applicant&#8217;s office could have exhibited these documents as being documents which have been received from the requesting state, but there would be absolutely no value in cross-examining that deponent since he or she is not the author of the documents in question. The only satisfactory cross-examination from the respondent&#8217;s point of view would be of the author of the reports themselves who would have to travel from the requesting state in order to be available for such cross-examination. I am satisfied that even if such a person was compellable as a witness, it is wholly outside the accepted procedures for extradition proceedings that such would be required.&quot;</font></ul>
</ul>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The High Court reached determinations on the other issues raised, to which I shall not refer at this stage.  	</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">12.	</font><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Grounds of Appeal</font></u></b><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The appellant has filed a number of grounds of appeal submitting that the learned trial judge erred in law and in fact in ordering the surrender of the appellant to the Russian Federation.  One of the initial grounds of appeal was that the learned trial judge erred in law in admitting evidence and relying on documents proved pursuant to s.37 of the Extradition Act, 1965.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">13.	</font><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Submissions</font></u></b><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Written and oral submissions were made on behalf of the appellant and the Attorney General.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	On the documentation issue it was submitted on behalf of the appellant that s.37 of the Extradition Act, 1965 refers to &quot;documents supporting a request for extradition&quot; and on the proper limited interpretation of this, such documents are confined to those referred to as in s.25(1) and &quot;evidence as to any matter to which such proceedings relate&quot; are properly the subject of affidavit evidence under s.7B.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	On behalf of the Attorney General it was submitted that the documents admissible under s.37 are not limited to those set out in s.25 of the Extradition Act, 1965.  It was submitted that the plain and ordinary meaning of the phrase &quot;a document supporting a request from a requesting country&quot; leads to the conclusion that any documents sent for the purposes of supporting a request, whether initially with the request or subsequently in response to a query raised, is admissible thereunder provided it is signed and sealed as required.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	It was further submitted on behalf of the Attorney General that if, which is not accepted, there is any doubt as to the plain words in s.37, that s.37 falls to be interpreted in the light of &quot;the principle of mutual trust and confidence &#8230; at the heart of &#8230; bilateral or multilateral extradition arrangements.&quot;  It was submitted that such an approach would eschew reliance upon the type of technicality raised on the appellant's behalf.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">14.	</font><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Decision</font></u></b><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The learned trial judge held that the provisions of s.29 of the Act of 1965, being matters upon which a court must be satisfied prior to an order of extradition, were met.  Further, that the offence was a corresponding offence.  No issue arises on these fundamental matters.  The issues which arise do so from the allegations made in the High Court, and on appeal to this Court, by the appellant.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	In response to the appellant's allegations, the Ambassador of the Russian Federation forwarded a &quot;reference letter&quot; rejecting the appellant's account of ill-treatment, signed by Mr. Bulanova, Deputy Prosecutor, Irbit Inter-Area Public Prosecutor's Office, Chief Adviser of Justice.  The letter exhibited:-</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	(a)	a copy of the interrogation report of Mr. Vaganov;</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	(b)	a copy of the official Inspection Report;</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	(c)	a copy of the Administrative Violation Report;</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	(d)	a copy of the report on the personal search of the appellant;</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	(e)	a copy of the report on detention conditions in temporary custody centres and pre-trial detention facilities in the Sverdlovsk region.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">15.	The first issue is as to the appropriate method of putting these matters in evidence: whether the documents may be admitted under the provisions of s.37 of the Act of 1965 or, s.7B.  It is a </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">matter of statutory law.  </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">16.	</font><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Statute Law</font></u></b><br>
<br>

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">17.	</font><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Issue</font></u></b><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The issue to be determined is whether s.37 is applicable to the documents furnished in response to the appellant's allegations, or whether other statutory provisions apply.    </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">18.	</font><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Section 37</font></u></b><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Section 37 of the Extradition Act, 1965, as amended, applies to proceedings to which Part II applies.  Part II applies to these proceedings.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Section 37 was applied to the formal documents presented to the High Court pursuant to s.25 of the Extradition Act, 1965.  They were received in evidence and no issue arises on these fundamental documents.  Thus s.37 enabled those documents to be received in evidence without further proof.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Section 37 states that &quot;a document supporting a request for extradition from a requesting country shall be received in evidence without further proof&quot; if it complies with the section.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Section 37 applies to &quot;a document supporting a request for extradition from a requesting country&quot;.  The term &quot;a document supporting a request for extradition&quot; is not further defined.  However, it clearly refers to &quot;documents supporting a request&quot;.  Section 25 refers to the documents to support a request.  It is mandatory in requiring certain documents to support a request.  The section has been set out in full earlier in the judgment, as may be seen the section lists as required (a) the original or authenticated copy of the conviction and sentence or detention order or warrant of arrest; (b) a statement of the offences/s for which extradition is requested; (c) a copy of the relevant law of the requesting country; (d) a description of the requested person; (e) any other document under the relevant extradition provisions.  This is a mandatory list of the documents to accompany a request.  Thus it is a special category of documents - without which a request for extradition can not proceed.  By using the words &quot;a document supporting a request for extradition&quot; in s.37 a logical link has been established between the two sections.  The words of s.37 are precise and are expressly related to a document supporting a request.  There are no wider terms, such as &quot;a document in extradition proceedings&quot;.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The words of s.37 are clear.  The plain meaning of the words are that they apply to the documents supporting the request, as listed in s.25.  I am satisfied that s.37 applies to the documents listed in s.25, that is the documents to support the request, which are listed in s.25.  Section 25(1)(a) to (d) sets out precise descriptions of what is required.  Section 25(1)(e) provides for &quot;other documents required under the relevant extradition provisions.&quot;  This is not a general catch all phrase.  It refers to further documents required under the relevant extradition provisions.  Thus, for example, further precise documents may be required under the arrangements between requesting and requested states.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	I am satisfied that the exception provided in s.37, the rule of admissibility provided in s.37, applies only to the documents of s.25.  I do not believe that it was the intention to apply this rule to other documents.  It is a narrowly based statutory rule.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">19.	</font><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Other than a Convention country</font></u></b><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Neither party in these proceedings relied upon or referred to the words &quot;other than a Convention country&quot; in s.37.  Thus no part of this decision relates to those words, or may be inferred to so relate.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Section 37 of the Extradition Act, 1965 was amended by s.17 of the Extradition (European Conventions) Act 2001. That latter Act sought generally to incorporate into Irish law two European Union treaties on extradition: the Convention on Simplified Extradition Procedures of 10th March, 1995, and the Convention on Extradition of 27th September, 1996.  Part 3 of the Act of 2001, in which the amending s.17 is contained, relates to the implementation of the 1996 Convention. The amended version of s.37 of the Extradition Act, 1965 creates two separate regimes for the authentication of material in support of a request for extradition. Section 37(1) deals with material from a country &quot;other than a Convention country&quot;, whilst sections 37(2) and (3) deal with material from a &quot;Convention country&quot;. Section 9 of the Act of 2001 amends s.3 of the Extradition Act, 1965 by stating that a &quot;Convention country&quot; means a country designated under s.10(1) of the Act of 2001.  Section 10 of the Act of 2001 provides that the Minister for Foreign Affairs may designate any country that has adopted the Convention of 1996.  However, to date, no order under this section appears to have been made.  As such, there are no Convention countries for the purposes of sections 37(2) and (3) of the Extradition Act, 1965.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Section 37(1) of the Extradition Act, 1965, as amended, operates in relation to countries to which the 1996 Convention and the procedures under the European Arrest Warrant scheme do not apply; one of these countries, by virtue of the Extradition Act 1965 (Application of Part II) Order 2000 (S.I. No. 474 of 2000), is the Russian Federation.  Consequently, the relevant applicable law in this case is s.37(1).</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">20.	</font><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Section 7B</font></u></b><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Section 7B of the Extradition Act, 1965 refers to the giving of evidence in proceedings under the Act.  It is a section relating to the giving of evidence by affidavit, or, by oral evidence.  It is a broad provision.  It is not linked, as is s.37, to &quot;a document supporting a request&quot;.  It is not limited by such a link.  This statutory provision exists together with that of s.37.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">21.	There is a clear statutory scheme as to the proof of documents.  The formal documents supporting the request may be received in evidence without further proof if the requirements in s.37 </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">have been met.  Further documents, filed by either party, are not part of the formal documents supporting a request and should be in compliance with s.7B of the Act of 1965.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">22.	In this case the documents supporting the request met the requirements of s.37 and were received in evidence by the learned trial judge.  There has been no appeal on this issue.  Thus his </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">finding that the provisions of s.25 of the Act of 1965 have been met stands.  However, the other documents filed to meet the allegations of the appellant on behalf of the requesting state, purported </font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">to meet the requirements of s.37.   This was an error, as the applicable provisions are those of s.7B.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">23.	In the circumstances I would remit the matter to the High Court.  This will enable the parties to bring the evidence in the appropriate form before the High Court for consideration.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">24.	</font><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Part II and not a European Arrest Warrant</font></u></b><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	This is a request made pursuant to Part II of the Extradition Act, 1965, which is applicable to a request from the Russian Federation.  It is not a request pursuant to the European Arrest Warrant Scheme of the European Union.  The concepts of mutual cooperation and mutual trust which are at the root of the European Arrest Warrant Scheme do not apply to a request pursuant to the Extradition Act, 1965.  The developing jurisprudence and presumptions of the European Arrest Warrant System do not apply to an application under Part II of the Act of 1965</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">25.	</font><b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Conclusion</font></u></b><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	For the reasons given I would allow the appeal to the extent addressed, that is on the documentation issue.  I would remit this case to the High Court so that if the appellant wishes she may bring evidence before the Court according to the appropriate statutory law.  Also, the Attorney General may wish to bring evidence before the Court and this may be done pursuant to s.7B.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	In so deciding I make no decision on the substantive issues raised, nor should any decision be inferred.  The High Court judge will be in the position to consider this matter </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">de novo</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> on the evidence which may be brought before the Court.</font>
