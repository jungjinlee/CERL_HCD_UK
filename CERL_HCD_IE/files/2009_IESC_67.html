<br>
<b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Judgment delivered by Macken, J. on the 31st day of July 2009.</font></u></b><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	This is an appeal from the judgment of the High Court (Peart, J.) and the Order made thereon on the 28th January 2009, by which the appellant was ordered to be surrendered to the authorities in Poland pursuant to the provisions of s.16 of the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003, as amended, (hereinafter &#8220;the Act of 2003&#8221;).  </font><br>
<u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Background:</font></u><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	A European Arrest Warrant was issued by the appropriate judicial authority of Poland in respect of the appellant, for the purposes of having him surrendered to serve the remainder or outstanding portion of a sentence imposed on him in respect of two separate offences.  The sentence was one of four years and six months and was a single or composite sentence.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The warrant discloses that one of the offences is one which falls within the provisions of Article 2.2 of the Framework Decision, being the offence of &#8220;racketeering and extortion&#8221; and in the warrant - which was presented in the form in which it appears in the Annex to the Framework Decision - the relevant box referring to that offence was ticked.  The second offence not being an offence which falls within Article 2.2 of the Framework Decision, is nevertheless accepted as being a corresponding offence within s.5 of the Act of 2003.  In the present case, that offence corresponds to the offence of robbery within this jurisdiction.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The appeal is opposed by the respondent.</font><br>
<br>
<br>
<u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The judgment:</font></u><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	In the High Court it was agreed, or established, that the balance of the sentence yet to be served is one year and 173 days.  The learned High Court judge found that the length of sentence satisfied the minimum gravity requirement of at least four months provided for in s.38(1)(a)(ii) in the Act of 2003 which implemented the Framework Decision in Irish law.  The learned High Court judge also found that the word &#8220;offence&#8221; is used loosely and interchangeably in the Framework Decision, and insofar as use of the word &#8220;offence&#8221; is concerned the court was entitled to have regard to the provisions of the Interpretation Act 2005 by which a word importing the singular can also be read as importing the plural.  The learned High Court judge distinguished the facts arising in this court&#8217;s decision in </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform v Ferenca</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> [2008] (unreported, 31st July 2008) and found that, contrary to the position in that case, the minimum gravity requirement was here met.</font><br>
<u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The appeal:</font></u><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	There is really only one issue arising in this appeal, and it concerns the appellant&#8217;s contention that the provisions of s.38 of the Act of 2003, as amended, do not permit the surrender of the appellant pursuant to the warrant.  This is based on a rather technical argument in the following terms.  Where a person has been made subject to a combined or composite sentence in the issuing state as here, and that state does not distinguish the term of the sentence imposed in respect of one offence as compared to the other offence, it is not possible to conclude that the minimum gravity requirements of the section have been met.  Secondly, the Act of 2003 must be interpreted and applied independently to offences which fall within Article 2.2 of the Framework Decision pursuant to s.38(1)(b) and an offence which is a corresponding offence to one within the jurisdiction, which falls under s.38(1)(a)(ii).  This arises it is argued by virtue of the wording of s.38 itself, which is in the following terms:</font><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">1	Subject to subsection (2), a person shall not be surrendered to an issuing state under this Act in respect of an offence unless &#8211; </font></i>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		(a)	the offence corresponds to an offence under the law of the state 			and &#8211;</font></i></ul>
</ul>

<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">i.	under the law of the issuing state the offence is punishable by imprisonment or detention for a maximum period of not less than 12 months or</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">ii.	a term of imprisonment or detention of not less than 4 months has been imposed on the person in respect of the offence in the issuing state, and the person is required under the law of the issuing state to serve all or part of that term of imprisonment.</font></i>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	or </font><br>

<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(b)      the offence is an offence to which paragraph 2 of Article 2 of the Framework Decision applies or is an offence that consists of conduct specified in that paragraph, and under the law of the issuing state the offence is punishable by imprisonment for a maximum period of not less than 3 years.</font></i></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Section 38(1)(a) reflects, in the Act of 2003, the provisions of Article 2.1 of the Framework Decision which provides:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	&#8220;</font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">A European Arrest Warrant may be issued for acts punishable by the law of the issuing member state by a custodial sentence or a detention order for a maximum period of at least twelve months or, where a sentence has been passed or a detention order has been made, for sentences of at least four months.&#8221;</font></i><br>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Senior counsel for the appellant relies on the decision of this court in </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform v Ferenca, </font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">supra., in support of his contention that the issuing state is obliged, in order to comply with the provisions of the Act of 2003, to furnish information in relation to the sentence imposed in respect of each of the offences for which the appellant has been sought to be surrendered, invoking in that regard, my judgment in which I made certain observations in respect of the provisions of s.38 of the Act of 2003.  It cannot however be overlooked that the decision in that case turned on a very particular and specific difficulty.  While the sentence was a composite sentence in respect of three different offences, one of those offences was neither an offence which fell within the provisions of Article 2.2 of the Framework Decision, nor a corresponding offence within the meaning of s.5 of the Act of 2003.  In such circumstances, as was pointed out by Murray, C.J. in the same case:</font>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	&#8220;The question remains whether any order for surrender can be made on foot of the European Arrest Warrant given that two of the three offences for which the sentence of two years and nine months was imposed are offences in relation to which a surrender order may be made.  </font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	As I pointed out at the outset and which is clear from the terms of the European Arrest Warrant, the sentence imposed is single sentence, what one might call a composite sentence, imposed for three offences collectively.  </font></i><i><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">If the appellant were to be surrendered to serve that sentence he would be surrendered to serve a sentence which was in part imposed for the first offence.</font></u></i><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">  I have already concluded above that the first offence is an offence for which s.38(1) says the appellant should not be surrendered. There is obviously no basis on which this court can apportion part of the sentence of two years and nine months among the three offences so that he could be surrendered for the purposes of serving the amount of the sentence which related to the second and third offences.  </font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Since that cannot be done, and he cannot be surrendered to serve any sentence in respect of the first offence, the request for his surrender must be refused.&#8221;</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">That was the basis upon which the appellant in that case could not be surrendered, and the basis for the finding of the court.</font><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">  	</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In my judgment on the same issue I specifically stated:</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	</font>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	&#8220;I make no finding at all based on the more general argument that the warrant would have to fall even if all three offences were ones upon which the appellant could have been surrendered.&#8221;</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	It is true that in that case I endeavoured to find a true meaning for the inelegantly drafted provisions of s.38, but the </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Ferenca </font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">case is wholly distinguishable, and is distinguished, from this case by virtue of the fact that one of the three offences in respect of which a composite sentence had been imposed, was an offence in respect of which the appellant could not be surrendered at all.  In the present appeal the position is entirely different.  One offence is an offence in respect of which Article 2.2 applies, and the other is clearly a corresponding offence, and there is no debate in respect of this.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The court is obliged to interpret the Act of 2003 in accordance with the intention and the purpose of the Framework Decision (see </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Pupino</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> case c-105103 [2005] E.C.R. I-5285 and this has been stated in several cases in this jurisdiction applying the decision in </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Pupino</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> which do not require to be cited.  The learned High Court judge found that the use of the words &#8220;offence&#8221; and &#8220;offences&#8221; are used both loosely and interchangeably in the Framework Decision itself, and gave examples of this. Moreover, the form of the warrant in the present case accords with the Annex to the Framework Decision and the form clearly contemplates, by its wording, that a warrant may relate to more than one offence.  It has in fact a specific portion in it where the number of offences to which it relates is to be inserted.  Nevertheless in the Annex it is required that the issuing state merely specifies the length of the custodial sentence imposed, and of that sentence the amount remaining to be served.  The form of warrant does not, on its face, require separate sentences to be specified.  The form of the warrant in the Annex forms part of the Act of 2003 because the Framework Decision itself together with the Annex, form a schedule to that Act. </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	 The Framework Decision is clearly intended to and is accepted as having been intended to be capable of being applied readily in a wide variety of different jurisdictions and in relation to different and varying methods of imposing sentence.  Interpreting the provisions of the act of 2003 by reference to the intention and purpose of the Framework Decision including the Annex is an obligation imposed on each member state as is also clear from the jurisprudence.  Since the provisions of section 38(1)(a) are disjunctive, the appellant can be surrendered provided that the minimum gravity thresholds under either (a)(i) or (a)(ii) is met.  In the present case the minimum gravity is significantly exceeded in respect of the offences, one offence having a maximum penalty of 10 years, and one offence of having a maximum penalty of 12 years.  I am satisfied also that a term of imprisonment or detention of not less than four months had been imposed on the person in respect of the offences arising in the present case.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Counsel for the appellant has invoked case law arising under the Extradition Act 1965. As has long been stated and repeated in the jurisprudence, extradition is an area of law which is sui generis. Equally the case law makes it clear that the European Arrest Warrant is also a new procedure entirely and also sui generis.  It is not possible, as I have stated in other cases, to transpose automatically the jurisprudence arising in extradition cases, to facts arising in European Arrest Warrant cases. As was stated by Murray, C.J. in </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform  v Sliczynski</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> (unreported, the Supreme Court, 19th December 2008): </font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;As I mention later in this judgment the act must be interpreted in the light of the terms of the Framework Decision which it implements and with particular regard to the objectives to be achieved.  The system or mechanism of surrender created by the Framework Decision applies in all member states of the European Union. Recital 5 in the preamble to the Framework Decision refers to &quot;the introduction of a new simplified system of surrender of sentenced or suspected persons for the purposes of execution or prosecution of criminal sentences ...&quot;It has as its object&quot; to remove the complexity and potential delay inherent &#8230;&quot; in pre-existing extradition procedures.&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	It seems to me that the contention on the part of the appellant that the appellant should not be surrendered because of the terms of s.38 of the Act is untenable because it would make it impossible to give effect to a warrant, which is in the actual format of the Annex to the Framework Decision, the purpose of the Act of 2003 being to facilitate surrender unless it is wholly clear that the Act of 2003 should  not permit this.  In any event I am satisfied that there is no legal reason for interpreting s.38 in any manner other than disjunctively, and it is plain that, read in such a way, the offences clearly meet the minimum threshold requirement.  Any alternative requires the impermissible addition of words or phrases to the section.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Having regard to the foregoing, I would affirm the Order of the High Court and dismiss the appeal. </font>
