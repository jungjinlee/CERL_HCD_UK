<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">1.	</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The parties to this appeal seek declarations as to the nature of the building contract entered into by the appellants (&#8220;the Hanly Group&#8221;) as employers and the respondent (&#8220;McCabes&#8221;) as contractor.</font><br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">2.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	By letter dated 5th August, 2005, from Mr. Alan Hanly, the chief executive of the Hanly Group, to Mr. Richard McCarthy, commercial director of McCabes, was countersigned and returned by Mr. McCarthy on 8th August.</font><br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">3.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	That letter stated in relation to a meeting the previous day, 4th August, as follows:-</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	&#8220;&#8230; we will be entering into a fixed price contract with the contractor to carry out the works at Kilmacanogue; there will however be 6 P.C. sums, three of which will be nominated suppliers and the other three will be at the contractor&#8217;s discretion.  In all cases, should there be an extra overspend on the 6 P.C. sums, it will be the developers responsibility to pay the difference.&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">4.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	That letter stated that the parties had reached agreement on the project via telephone.  The summary of their agreement appeared as follows:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	&#8220;The Healy Group will pay McCabe Builders &#8364;15.3million plus VAT for the contract as outlined in the Spec and Bill of Quantities at Kilmacanogue, Co. Wicklow.  The Hanly Group is entering into a fixed price contract and as stated earlier in this letter there are 6 P.C. sums of which there are only two nominated suppliers/sub-contractors (McNally Kitchens and Vogue Bathrooms).  In both cases McCabe Builders will be dealing directly with these suppliers.  However, the Hanly Group has already secured competitive quotes from both people and at any rate, as with other P.C. sums, should same increase; it will be an extra over-cost for the Hanly Group.  Our expertise and experience will assist in choosing both suppliers, particularly given the product in question as both suppliers will be able to deal efficiently with customers who wish to upgrade/change products.  This will be both beneficial to McCabe Contractors and the Hanly Group of developers.&#8221;   </font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The letter then stated that the parties proposed to take the opportunity over the coming days to work closely to finalise all outstanding issues.  It was noted that it would be beneficial to both of the companies to reach a conclusion on this upon signing of contracts.</font><br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">5.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The letter dealt with the understanding of the Hanly Group in the following terms:-</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	&#8220;it is the Hanly Group&#8217;s understanding that all correspondence forwarded to McCabe Builders from our offices and (the quantity surveyor&#8217;s offices) regarding conditions, planning conditions and special conditions are and form integral parts of our agreement.  I would be grateful if you could review this document, and if you concur that the conditions laid out in this document are as agreed, please sign below and return to our offices at your earliest convenience.&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">6.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The High Court found that the communication of the 5th and 8th August was ineffective to create legal relations, due to uncertainty, and that no contractual relations had been created between the parties.  The entitlement of the respondent in relation to payment for the work done to date was to be assessed on a </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">quantum meruit</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">.</font><br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">7.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The Hanly Group had engaged a firm of quantity surveyors to conduct an initial tendering process.  Tender documents were sent out to a number of builders, including McCabes on the last week of June, 2005.  The tender documents comprised a Bill of Approximate Quantities, a form of tender and architectural drawings and a landscape architect&#8217;s drawings.</font><br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">8.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The Bill of Approximate Quantities was in four volumes.  The preamble to the Bill of Approximate Quantities provided that the contractor was to &#8220;properly execute the works whether or not shown on the drawings or described in the Bill of Approximate Quantities, provided that same may be reasonably inferred therefrom&#8221;.</font><br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">9.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The contract drawings prepared for the appellant had not been sufficiently developed to enable tenderers to properly price the works with a required degree of specificity needed for a meaningful tender.  The specification document entitled &#8220;Specification of Materials&#8221;, consisting of 13 pages was very sparse.  To make up for this the appellant&#8217;s quantity surveyors provided a very detailed Bill of Approximate Quantities to allow tenderers price in detail for the works required.</font><br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">10.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	A provision had been made in the Bill of Approximate Quantities that the form of contract would be the Articles of Agreement and Conditions of Contract 2002 (revision 1, print 4) as issued by the R.I.A.I. in agreement with the Construction Industry Federation (C.I.F.) and Society of Chartered Surveyors (S.C.S.) where quantities did not form part of the contract.  That document also provided as a general condition at (G.C.2) that the contractor should carefully examine the drawings and other contract documents and satisfy himself as to their accuracy and ensure that they cover and embody the proposed works.  The contractor should also properly execute the works whether or not shown in the drawings and described in the Bill of Approximate Quantities, provided that same may reasonably be inferred therefrom.</font><br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">11.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The appellants submitted that the description in the Bill of Quantities in relation to the works, in the circumstances, formed part of the contract documents.</font><br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">12.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	On 10th August, works commenced on site.  </font><br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">13.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	On 26th August, 2005, Mr. Hanly wrote to Mr. McCarthy issuing a letter of intent for the works to the value of &#8364;1,000,000.00, primarily to cover the respondents for works that they were commencing on the site of presence in the absence of a fully signed contract.</font><br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">14.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The formal contract documentation, including the R.I.A.I &#8220;blue form&#8221;, was sent to the respondent on 24th November, 2005, for signature and return which was signed on 19th January, 2006.</font><br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">15.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The R.I.A.I. &#8220;blue form&#8221; accordingly became binding on 19th January, 2006. </font><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">16.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The Articles of Agreement thereof recited:- </font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;For the consideration hereinafter mentioned the contractor will upon and subject to the conditions annexed hereto execute and complete the works shown upon the contract drawings and/or described in the specification and conditions all of which together with this Agreement are hereinafter referred to as &#8216;the Contract Documents.&#8217;&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">17.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Condition 2 under the heading &#8220;The Scope of Contract&#8221; provided that the contractor should carry out and complete the works in accordance with the Contract Documents and with the directions and to the reasonable satisfaction of the architect&#8230;</font><br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">18.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Condition 3 (a)(ii) provided that where the Articles of Agreement did not provide for the inclusion of a Bill of Quantities as a Contract Document, the contract sum should be deemed to provide for the quantity and quality of work set out in the drawings and specifications.  The contractor was required, before the signing of the Articles of Agreement, to furnish the architect with a Schedule of Rates.  Where a Bill of Quantities was provided for tendering purposes the rates therein contained should be the Schedule of Rates.</font><br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">19.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	That condition further provided:-</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	&#8220;Nothing contained in the contractors estimate or the bills, the Bill of Quantities (except as a Schedule of Rates), shall confer rights or impose any obligations beyond those conferred or imposed by the Contract Documents.&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">20.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	This provision would seem to be at variance with the appellant&#8217;s contention that the description in the Approximate Bill of Quantities was effectively the Specification for the purpose of the Contract, notwithstanding that what was termed &#8220;the formal contract documentation&#8221; sent to the respondent on 24th November, 2005, included the letter of 5th .</font><br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">21.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Keane: The RIAI Contracts &#8211; A Working Guide (4th revised edition) comments on the RIAI &#8220;blue form&#8221; for use without quantities and the &#8220;yellow&#8221; version for use where quantities are part of the contract, as follows:-</font>
<ul><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;3.01.	The effect on the Contract as to whether the Bill of Quantities forms part of the Contract or not is important.  If the Bill of Quantities is a Contract Document then the quantities shown are those required under the Contract and any variation from the quantities shown in the bill will be adjusted in the final account under clause 13 as if it were a variation.</font>
<ul><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		If the Bill of Quantities is not part of the Contract, then the quantities are provided only as a guide to the extent of the work (but also, of course, to form in effect, a Schedule of Rates) and the contractor, or indeed the employer, must bear any loss which might result from differences in the bill in the actual work carried out.  The practice of having a Bill of Quantities not forming part of the Contract is unusual now and if a Bill of Quantities is prepared it is almost always made a Contract Document.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">3.02 	Originally, quantities were taken out by the contractors themselves when tendering, or the contractor employed a quantity surveyor to do this work.  Naturally, under those arrangements, the responsibility for the accuracy of the quantities fell entirely on the contractor.  Over the years, however, the role of the quantity surveyor changed, and more and more he became employed by the building owner.  It seemed reasonable in these changed circumstances, that the employer accept responsibility for the accuracy of the bill since he has ordered the preparation of that bill and his agent, the quantity surveyor, has prepared it.  This area was a profitable source of litigation until the case of </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Patman and Fotheringham Ltd. v. Pilditch</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> [1904] Huttons Building Contracts, 4th edition, vol. 2, p.368 where it was held:  &#8216;if the quantities in the Bill are less than those required by the drawings the contractor is entitled to be paid an appropriate addition to the contract sum since the quantities were introduced with the contract as part of the description of the contract work, and if the contractor was required to do more, it was an extra.&#8221;&#8217;</font></ul>
</ul>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">22.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Keane refers to the decision of Ross J. in </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Collin Bros. v. Dublin County Council</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> [1908] 1 I.R. 503, which dealt with the construction of Portrane Asylum, where the defendant sought to reduce the specification before contract.  Quantities did not form part of the contract.  A mistake had been made in a bill of reductions which had been prepared by the defendant employer&#8217;s quantity surveyor.  The court held that mistake could be rectified because &#8220;the meaning of rectification of a written instrument is to carry out the real intention of the parties which had been erroneously expressed&#8221; in respect of the building of the asylum for the defendants.  The Bill of Quantities had been priced by the plaintiffs in the sum of £199,000.00.  The reductions brought that sum down to under £170,000.00.  The building having been completed an error was discovered whereby the contractors lost £357.00.  It was accepted that there was a mutual mistake.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Ross J. was of the view that the court could not deal with the contract alone but had to deal with the tender.  The intention of the parties, when analysed, was that the tender for the original amount of the price to section, less the amount of the priced bill of reductions, should be accepted.  The sum of £167,000.00 was erroneously taken to be the figure, and erroneously embodied in the contract.  </font><br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">23.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Ross J. continued at 509, 510 as follows:-</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;The meaning of rectification of a written instrument is to carry out the real intention of the parties which has been erroneously expressed.  This is what the plaintiffs asked me to do.   There are all kinds of technical difficulties.  How can you rectify the deed without rectifying the tender?  How can you alter an accepted tender?  These technicalities ought not to be allowed to stand in the way of a court of equity, whose primary duty is to struggle to enforce fair dealing between man and man, if it can be done without violating some matter of principle.&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">24.	</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">There is no evidence of a common mistake in the present case; accordingly the issue of rectification cannot arise.  The tender could only be referred to where there was a mutual mistake in order to establish the true intention of the parties.</font><br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">25.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	There is no doubt that the parties intended on 5th August, 2005, to enter into an R.IA.I. Contract without quantities.  The only issue is what the specifications were and whether, notwithstanding the provisions in the contract eventually signed on 19th January, 2006, by the contractor. </font><br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">26.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Lord Denning in </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">English Industrial Estates Corporation v.

[1972] 7 B.L.R. 122, took the view that provisions which have been specially typed in a Bill of Quantities must take precedence over a standard printed form but this, according to Keane, is an unusual view.   </font><br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">27.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The provisions of clause 3(8)(i) which incorporates the Bill of Quantities, provides that nothing contained in the Bill should override, modify or affect in any way whatsoever the application or interpretation of that condition.</font><br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">28.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	It was s. 3(8)(ii) that applies in the present case.  That also provides that:-</font>
<ul><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	&#8220;Nothing contained in the contractors estimate or the Bill of Quantities (except as a Schedule of Rates) shall confer rights or impose any obligations beyond those conferred or imposed by the Contract Documents.&#8221;</font></ul>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">29.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	In clause 3(a)(i) the Bill of Quantities is deemed to provide for the quality and quantity of the work.  On the other hand in sub-clause 3(a)(ii) the drawings and specifications are to perform this function.</font><br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">30.</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	It would seem, accordingly, that, in the absence of a special condition in the R.I.A.I. &#8220;blue form&#8221; importing the description of works therein to include those described in the Approximate Bill of Quantities, only the drawings and specification, inadequate though they appear, can form the definition of works.  It is these that form the contract documents referred to in clause 3(b).</font><br>
<b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">31.	</font></b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">I am of the view that the R.I.A.I. contract without quantities binds the parties and would allow the appeal to that extent.  However, I am unable to accept the appellant&#8217;s contention that the R.I.A.I. contract can incorporate the description in the Approximate Bill of Quantities as being a definition of the works or as being part of the contract documentation. </font><br>
