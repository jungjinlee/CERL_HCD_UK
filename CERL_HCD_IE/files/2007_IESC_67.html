<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">JUDGMENT of MR. JUSTICE FENNELLY delivered the 20th day of December  2007</font></b>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">1.	This appellant, who is charged with a number of serious drugs offences, wants to have the Circuit Court determine in advance of his proposed trial whether a search warrant which was used to obtain the evidence against him was valid and to order that the charges be dismissed. Whether this can be done depends on the interpretation of provisions of section 9 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1999, which inserted a new section 4E into the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967 (&#8220;the Act of 1967&#8221;). That Act ended the preliminary examination procedure in the District Court. The trial Court, rather than the District Court, may now be asked to decide whether there is a sufficient case to answer. The appellant failed in his application before the first-named respondent.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2.	The Appellant brought the matter before the High Court in an application for Judicial Review. His application was dismissed by Quirke J in a judgment delivered on 8th December 2004.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Procedural history</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">3.	Seven charges have been laid against the Appellant. They all relate to alleged possession of controlled drugs at premises in Clondalkin, Dublin 12 on 20th June 2002. One charge alleges possession for sale or supply of drugs to a value of &#8364;13,000 or more contrary to section 15A (as inserted by section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1999) and section 27 (as amended by section 5 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1999) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977. I will refer to this as the section 15A charge.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">4.	The Appellant was charged on 18th April 2003 before the District Court. He was duly served with a book of evidence and returned for trial to the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court, where his case has been adjourned from time to time. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">5.	Counsel for the Appellant applied on 30th March 2004 to have the case against him dismissed pursuant to section 4E of the Act of 1967. According to his affidavit in the present proceedings, the Appellant contended:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">	&#8220;The Book of evidence fails to disclose any, or any admissible evidence to the effect that the drugs the subject-matter of the within prosecution, were lawfully seized by way of lawful authority by the investigating members of An Garda Siochana.</font>
<ul><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">1)	The Book of evidence herein fails to disclose any admissible evidence against the accused.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2)	The search warrant requested by and issued to the prosecuting Garda failed to include on its face the premises sought to be searched by them and was therefore invalid.&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">6.	The application was heard before the first-named respondent. Counsel for the appellant submitted that the previous procedure had been radically altered by the Act of 1999 and that the judge at the court of trial now has jurisdiction to determine the validity of a search warrant in an application by an accused person to have charges against him dismissed. According to the affidavit, counsel also submitted that &#8220;the procedure expanded the previous legislation by introducing the possibility of adducing oral evidence,&#8221; and that the trial court was &#8220;entitled to embark on the hearing of an application to dismiss where a point of law </font><u><font size="2" face="Verdana">or fact</font></u><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is raised by an accused which if successful, would dispense with the requirement of a jury to determine the guilt or innocence of an accused.&#8221; (emphasis added).</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7.	Having heard arguments which largely prefigure those advanced in the High Court and before this Court, the first-named respondent ruled on 11th May 2004 that the validity of search warrants was to be determined at the trial and could not be the subject-matter of an application to dismiss pursuant to section 4E of the Act of 1967. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">8.	The Appellant obtained leave from the High Court (McKechnie J) to apply for judicial review of the decision of the first-named respondent. The central ground for the application was that the first-named respondent was wrong in holding that section 4E precluded a determination as to the validity of a search warrant.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">9.	Quirke J dismissed the application for judicial review in a judgment delivered on 8th December 2004. He held that section 4E was &#8220;intended to enable an accuse person to make an application to have charges preferred against him dismissed where the evidence upon which the State intends to rely is so weak that there is no probable cause to believe that the accused might be guilty.&#8221; </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	He continued:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">	&#8220;It was clearly not intended that applicants pursuant to s. 4E would be entitled to challenge evidence disclosed in the Book of Evidence on grounds of credibility or weight. I am satisfied also that it was not intended that it should be challenged on grounds of admissibility. Such applicants (and the court hearing the applications) should take the State's case as disclosed in the Book of Evidence at its highest point.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	The admissibility of particular evidence will invariably require to be determined by the trial judge during a criminal trial. In determining admissibility the trial judge may require to hear evidence by way of a voire dire or to exercise discretion judicially as to the admission of particular evidence. The validity of a warrant may depend upon the state of mind of the person applying for or issuing the warrant. Enquiry into such matters cannot be properly conducted in isolation from all of the other evidence to be adduced in a criminal trial. It is undesirable that specific findings of fact or law should be made in advance of a criminal trial. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	In hearing an application pursuant to s. 4E of the 1967 Act (as amended) the trial court should consider the evidence upon which the State intends to rely on the assumption that it will be adduced lawfully and properly and as outlined in the Book of Evidence. The court must then decide whether, if so adduced, it discloses a 'prima facie' case against the accused.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	If so, the accused should be sent forward for trial. If not then the accused person should be discharged.&#8221;</font></ul>
<br>
</ul>
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Statutory provisions</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">10.	Part III of the Act of 1999 abolished the former system of preliminary examination in the District Court, as it had existed since the passing of the Act of 1967. Under the amended statutory regime, the District Court sends an accused person forward for trial to the appropriate court of jurisdiction. Section 4A of the Act of 1967, inserted by section 9 of the Act of 1999, provides that where &#8220;an accused person is before the District Court charged with an indictable offence, the Court shall send the accused forward for trial to the court before which he is to stand trial (the trial court)&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	Section 4E, inserted by the same section needs to be cited in its entirety:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">4E.&#8212;(1)	At any time after the accused is sent forward for trial, the accused may apply to the trial court to dismiss one or more of the charges against the accused. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(2)	Notice of an application under subsection (1) shall be given to the prosecutor not less than 14 days before the date on which the application is due to be heard. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(3)	The trial court may, in the interests of justice, determine that less than 14 days notice of an application under subsection (1) may be given to the prosecutor.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(4)	If it appears to the trial court that there is not a sufficient case to put the accused on trial for any charge to which the application relates, the court shall dismiss the charge.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(5) (a)	Oral evidence may be given on an application under subsection (1) only if it appears to the trial court that such evidence is required in the interests of justice.</font>
<ul><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(b)	In paragraph (a) &#8216;oral evidence&#8217;  includes&#8212;</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">(i)	any evidence given through a live television link pursuant to Part III of the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992 , or section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1999, or</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii)	a videorecording of any evidence given through a live television link pursuant to that Part or section in proceedings under section 4F.</font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(6)	Where the trial court is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice that any document required under this Part to be served on the accused or his solicitor be served at the hearing of an application under this section&#8212;</font>
<ul><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(a)	the prosecutor shall serve the document on the accused or his solicitor, if any, at the hearing, and</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(b)	the court may, if it considers it appropriate to do so, adjourn the hearing for that purpose.</font></ul>
<br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(7)	Where a charge is dismissed by the trial court under subsection (4), the prosecutor may, within 21 days after the dismissal date, appeal against the dismissal to the Court of Criminal Appeal.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(8)	On an appeal under subsection (7), the Court of Criminal Appeal may&#8212;</font>
<ul><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(a)	affirm the decision of the trial court, or</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(b)	quash the decision of the trial court, in which case the trial of the accused may proceed as if the charge had never been dismissed.</font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">11.	It is appropriate, at this point, to recall that section 5 of the Act of 1967, repealed by the Act of 1999, had provided that, where an accused person was charged before the District Court with an indictable offence, the judge was to &#8220;conduct a preliminary examination of the charge in accordance with the provisions&#8221; of the relevant part of the Act. Section 8(1) of that Act provided:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">	&#8220;If the justice is of opinion that there is a sufficient case to put the accused on trial for the offence with which he has been charged, he shall send him forward for trial.&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">12.	Subsections (2) and (4) provided, respectively, for cases where &#8220;some indictable offence other than that charged&#8221; and cases where only a summary offence is disclosed. Subsection (5) provided:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">	&#8220;If none of the foregoing provisions applies, the justice shall order the accused to be discharged as to the offence under examination.&#8221;</font></ul>
<br>
</ul>
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Submissions for Appellant </font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">13.	Mr Michael O&#8217;Higgins, Senior Counsel, informed the Court that the Appellant wishes to challenge the legality of the search warrant which was the means used by the Garda Síochána to obtain the evidence against him. He said that, if he succeeds in that objective, he will be able to secure the exclusion of the only evidence against him disclosed in the book of evidence, and there would not then be a sufficient case to put the accused on trial. For that purpose, he would adduce evidence, on the hearing of the application under section 4E, that the premises whose address was on the warrant was not the premises which was in fact searched. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">14.	The Appellant submitted that, as the court of trial has now the function of conducting the preliminary examination, section 4E does not limit the scope of the investigation that the trial court can enter into in determining the question as to whether an accused person has a case to answer. As the procedure for preliminary examination now vests in the trial court, that court can decide on the validity of search warrants and dismiss any charge pursuant to Section 4E prior to the commencement of a trial before a judge and jury.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	Moreover, whether a warrant is legally issued or not is a matter of law. It would be decided at trial, in the absence of the jury. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">15.	Section 4E permits the admission of oral testimony (subject to the leave of the trial judge). The appellant submits that the intention of the Oireachtas in inserting this section was to circumvent the many </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">voir dire</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> applications that occur during the course of trials. An applicant under section 4E need not rely solely on the alleged facts as disclosed in the book of evidence, but can call witnesses to substantiate the application that he or she is making. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">16.	The appellant also relied on the sentencing regime governing those convicted of section 15A offences. A person so convicted is subject to a minimum period of imprisonment of 10 years, unless the Court is satisfied that, </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">inter alia</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, the accused pleaded guilty and indicated an intention to do so at an early stage. Thus the timing of the plea of guilty is critical. Where a person faces a mandatory minimum sentence because he fails to derive a benefit from an early plea, it naturally diminishes the resolve to contest a trial because he runs the risk that such decision would affect his sentence, if convicted. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">17.	The written submissions filed on behalf of the appellant lay particular emphasis on the risks, in the context of section 15A, of relying on purely technical defences. Section 15A of the Misuse of Drugs Act, it is submitted, has huge implications for an accused person who intends to rely on a technical defence. </font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Submissions of Respondents</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">18.	The Respondents submit that questions of admissibility of evidence are determined by the trial judge in the context of the evidence that he or she has heard and are determined at the time when they arise in the course of the evidence. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">19.	The appellant claims that all questions of law and fact that would be ruled on in the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">voir dire</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of a criminal trial that would result in the charges being dismissed should be capable of being determined in the course of a motion to dismiss. If the appellant is correct, motions to dismiss could presumably canvas all types of issues such as the legality of detention or the admissibility of confessions. This could fundamentally alter the manner in which criminal trials have traditionally been conducted in this jurisdiction. The drafters of the 1999 Act did not intend to effect such a fundamental change in the nature of the criminal process. Such change could only be effected by legislation duly passed by the Oireachtas.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">20.	The advance determination of such issues would not necessarily assist the administration of justice. If the application pursuant to section 4E were not, contrary to the appellant&#8217;s submissions, dismissed because the contested evidence was ruled admissible, that would not necessarily bind the trial court. The accused person would be entitled to run the entire issue of admissibility for a second time at trial, so that there would be no saving. Reference was made to the decision of this Court in Lynch v Moran [2006] 3 IR 389 to the effect that issue estoppel has no role in Irish criminal proceedings.  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">21.	The fact that s 4E provides that oral evidence can be heard &#8220;if it appears to the trial court that such evidence is required in the interests of justice&#8221; cannot be used as a basis for suggesting that the section intended to alter the fundamental nature of a criminal trial. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">22.	Mr Paul Anthony McDermott submitted at the hearing of the appeal that the judge should consider the book of evidence, taking the prosecution case at its highest, and assuming the evidence is admissible. He submitted that section 4E constituted the transplantation of the old procedure from the District Court to the court of trial. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">23.	The Respondents relied on the decisions of Hamilton J, as he then was, in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Byrne v Grey</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1988] IR 31 and </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Berkeley v Edwards</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1988] IR 217 and that of McCracken J in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">DPP v Windle</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1999] 4 IR 280. Mr McDermott also suggested that the proposal for advance determination of issues of admissibility would be inconsistent with the principle of the unitary nature of a criminal trial as laid down in a number of authorities. </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">The People (Attorney General) v McGlynn</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1967] IR 232, </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Corporation of Dublin v Flynn</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1980] IR 357 and </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">DPP v Special Criminal Court &amp; Paul Ward</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1999] 1 IR 60 were cited. </font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Considerations and conclusions</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">24.	Before turning to the interpretation of section 4E, it is essential to identify the precise parameters of what the appellant was asking the first-named respondent to decide. He describes the &#8220;grounds&#8221; of the application for dismissal of the charges as being that:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">a)	the &#8220;book of evidence herein fails to disclose any admissible evidence&#8221; and </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">b)	the &#8220;search warrant requested by and issued to the prosecuting Garda failed to include on its face the premises sought to be searched by them and was therefore invalid&#8221;.</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">25.	Both of these arguments could have been advanced without any oral evidence. I am assuming here that the search warrant formed part of the book of evidence. It should be included as an exhibit served pursuant to section 4B, also inserted in the Act of 1967 by section 9 of the Act of 1999. Mr O&#8217;Higgins explained that the evidence to be called would be to the effect that that the premises whose address was on the warrant was not the premises which was in fact searched. Thus, very limited evidence would have sufficed and I will return to that. I cannot conceive that the proof of such a simple fact would present any practical difficulty. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">26.	At any rate, the appellant does not disclose that any such limited application was made to the first-named Respondent. Rather, he appears to have made a very much broader case that the section does not limit in any way the scope of issues that may be determined on an application pursuant to section 4E and that the court may determine issues, not merely of law, but of fact. Again, the appellant does not appear to accept any limits to that power.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">27.	I propose to consider the matter both on the broad basis advanced in argument and the narrower basis originally proposed before the first-named respondent.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	The statutory context of the Act of 1999 provides the most cogent explanation of the scope and purpose of section 4E. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">28.	Part II of the Act of 1967 laid down rules for the preliminary examination of indictable offences in the District Court. Section 5 imposed the general obligation on a judge of that court. Section 6 dealt with the service of documents constituting what we call the book of evidence. Section 7(1) required the judge to consider those documents and &#8220;any deposition or statement taken in accordance with this section and any submissions that may be made by or on behalf of the prosecutor or the accused.&#8221; Section 7(2) permitted both the prosecutor and the accused &#8220;to give evidence on sworn deposition and also to require the attendance before the justice of any person, whether included in the supplied list of witnesses or not, and to examine him by way of sworn deposition.&#8221; Section 8(1) provided:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">	&#8220;If the justice is of opinion that </font><u><font size="2" face="Verdana">there is a sufficient case to put the accused on trial</font></u><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for the offence with which he has been charged, he shall send him forward for trial.&#8221; (emphasis added)</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">29.	It is crucial, as I will explain, that the underlined words have been repeated in section 4E, though the sense is reversed: if &#8220;there is </font><u><font size="2" face="Verdana">not</font></u><font size="2" face="Verdana"> a sufficient case to put the accused on trial&#8230;&#8221; the charge will be dismissed. (emphasis added). This makes no material difference to the meaning.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">30.	In </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">DPP v Windle</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [1999] 4 I.R. 280 McCracken J considered the jurisdiction of a judge of the District Court to rule on the validity of a search warrant. The accused was charged with certain drugs offences. The prosecution intended to rely on evidence secured on foot of a search warrant. During the preliminary examination, the District Judge raised the question of validity of the warrant. The warrant did not state on its face that the person authorising it was a peace commissioner for the area which comprised the premises which were searched. The District Judge ruled the warrant invalid, the evidence inadmissible, and refused to return the accused for trial. The prosecution applied successfully for judicial review.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	McCracken J held (see page 284):</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">	&#8220;I am quite satisfied that it is not for a judge conducting a preliminary investigation to determine the validity or otherwise of a search warrant. This is a matter purely for the trial judge, to be determined by him on the evidence before him. If there had been no search warrant in the present case, then certainly the District Judge would have been justified in refusing to send the second respondent forward for trial, as there would have been no evidence to justify the search of his premises, but once a search warrant existed, in my view the question of its validity was one for the trial and not one for a preliminary investigation.&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	McCracken J referred, at several points in his judgment, to the fact that further evidence could be called at trial. The decision in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Windle</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is not necessarily conclusive for the purposes of the present application. It does not bind this Court and it is concerned with legislation which has since been repealed. It does, however, highlight the distinction between the decision that there is no sufficient case, a term carried over from the former regime, to put a person on trial and a decision at the trial itself on the hearing of all the evidence.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">31.	The broader case advanced on behalf of the appellant is, as submitted on behalf of the respondents, extremely far-reaching. The appellant submits that there is no limit to the type of preliminary issue that may be determined on a section 4E application and that the power of the court, on such application, extends to the resolution of disputed issues of fact.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">32.	I prefer the view of the respondents. This does not necessarily mean that the jurisdiction exercised pursuant to section 4E is identical with the former jurisdiction of the District Court to decline to send a person forward for trial. Some weight should be attached to the fact that the decision is being made by the actual trial court and to the faculty for the admission of evidence.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">33.	Nonetheless, it would require clear legislative wording to establish an entirely novel jurisdiction to determine, in advance of trial, disputed issues of law or fact. The appellant&#8217;s submissions would appear to open the door to determination, for example and probably most notably, of contested admissibility of incriminating statements or disputes about lawfulness of detention. It is notorious that trial courts may spend days or even weeks hearing evidence and cross-examination in the absence of the jury touching on alleged confessions made in garda custody. Hardiman J refers to these problems in the judgment he has just delivered. The parties have referred, in oral and written submissions, to various reports and recommendations for the introduction of procedures such as &#8220;plea and directions hearings.&#8221; Such procedures have generally been introduced by statute in other common-law countries. The power to make binding preliminary rulings on admissibility would clearly require statutory intervention. What is clear, however, is that no existing legislative authority exists for such procedures in this jurisdiction.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">34.	There is a further difficulty. If an issue of admissibility is determined not in favour of but against an accused person, it seems clear that such a determination would not be binding at the subsequent trial. This Court decided in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Lynch v Moran</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2006] 3 IR 389 that issue estoppel has no role in Irish criminal proceedings, either in favour of the prosecution or of the defence. In the absence of legislative provision, therefore, the proposed interpretation might lead to duplication of hearings on contested issues of admissibilituy and thus increase rather than reduce the burden on the courts. This seems to me to be sufficient to dispose of the Appellant&#8217;s argument based on convenience and economy. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">35.	The aim of section 4E was, so far as possible, to confer on the trial court a jurisdiction similar to that exercised by the District Court at the conclusion of the preliminary examination. The question for the court is the same as it was formerly for the District Court: is there a sufficient case to put the accused on trial? The application to dismiss can be made at any time after the return for trial. It is necessarily confined (subject to the evidence issue discussed later) to what is disclosed in what we loosely call the book of evidence. I agree with the view of Quirke J that the court should take the prosecution case at its strongest and assume that the evidence disclosed in the book of evidence is admissible. Put otherwise, is there a prima facie case?</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">36.	Even without the possibility of admitting evidence at the hearing of the application, I would not necessarily approach the issue as strictly as McCracken J did in the </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Windle</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> case. Some evidence, such as hearsay, may be self-evidently inadmissible. McCracken J himself accepted that, if there were no search warrant, in a case where one was required as a matter of law, the District Judge might hold evidence to be inadmissible and refuse a return for trial. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">37.	As originally presented, the appellant&#8217;s case appears to be of that narrower type. It was argued before first-named respondent that the &#8220;search warrant requested by and issued to the prosecuting Garda failed to include on its face the premises sought to be searched by them.&#8221; As I have mentioned, Mr O&#8217;Higgins phrased the matter somewhat differently: the premises actually searched was not that named in the warrant. In my view, the trial court could decide an issue of that sort on a section 4E application. It may be, however, that the Appellant&#8217;s submission depends on the establishment of some simple and uncontroversial fact. At this point, the jurisdiction to admit evidence becomes relevant.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">38.	The first point to note is that the primary rule is that evidence will not be admitted. That follows logically from the fact that the court is to decide whether a sufficient case is disclosed by the documents forming the book of evidence. However, section 4E provides that &#8220;oral evidence may be given on an application under subsection (1) only if it appears to the trial court that such evidence is required in the interests of justice.&#8221;  I cannot accept that this provision is to be read as constituting a general power for the judge to admit evidence. The purpose of any such evidence must be to cast light on the issue which the court has to determine, namely whether, on the book of evidence, there is a sufficient case to put the accused on trial. Thus, evidence should be admitted to explain the identity of persons, places or things referred to in the documents. It is necessarily difficult to lay down comprehensive rules about this. The guiding principle is the interests of justice, but controlled by the context of the application and the circumstances of the particular case. Always, the issue is whether a sufficient case is disclosed. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">39.	The extended definition of &#8220;oral evidence&#8221; given in section 4E to include evidence given by live television link, pursuant to three specified statutory provisions, does not affect the interpretation I have adopted. I have already said that the section permits evidence to be given in the interests of justice in order to cast light on the question of whether there is &#8220;a sufficient case.&#8221; It is logical that that faculty should include evidence given by live television link where that is permitted. The first two specified provisions, section 39 of the Supreme Court of 1999 and Part III of the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992 (of which only section 13 is capable of applying) apply only to a person other than the accused. The third, section 4F, also inserted by section 9 of the Act of 1999, relates only to evidence given by deposition or live videolink in the District Court pursuant to an order made by the court of trial after the return for trial. In effect, therefore, that evidence becomes part of the body of evidence to be considered with the book of evidence in an application under section 4E, if available at that time.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">40.	I am satisfied that it was not intended that section 4E would provide an independent free-standing procedure for the determination of preliminary issues. It would make no sense to provide such a procedure merely for those cases where the accused contended that there was no sufficient case to put him on trial but not to cases where contested evidence formed part only of the material to be produced at trial. If the power existed, it would have to apply to all cases. Put otherwise, the court is not required to determine any such preliminary issue, where the documents disclose other evidence against the accused.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">41.	The foregoing view receives support from the fact that the prosecution may appeal the dismissal of a charge. No corresponding right is conferred on the defence. That is because, for the prosecution a decision to dismiss is final: it ends the prosecution. Not so, where the charge is not to dismiss the charges. The case proceeds to trial, all defence rights being preserved. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">42.	Thus, I would reject the broader argument advanced on behalf of the Appellant. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">43.	That conclusion does not, however, necessarily dispose of the instant case. The subject-matter of the application for judicial review is the decision of first-named respondent of 11th May 2004. According to the uncontradicted evidence of the Appellant the first-named respondent ruled that the validity of search warrants was to be determined at the trial and could not be the subject-matter of an application to dismiss pursuant to section 4E of the Act of 1967. In effect, he declined jurisdiction to consider the question of validity of the search warrant. His decision did not turn on whether he should admit evidence. I am satisfied that first-named respondent erred in reaching this conclusion. To be fair to the learned judge, he may have been faithfully following the decision of McCracken J in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Windle</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">. Nonetheless, he should have been prepared to consider arguments on the issue of validity as disclosed in the documents and, possibility, whether evidence should be admitted to explain the circumstances of the search or the identity of the premises though only in the sense that a ruling of invalidity would have the effect of ruling out all the evidence against the accused. I do not think it has been established that there is any overriding rule that the decision on whether there is a sufficient case to put a person on trial precludes the judge hearing such an application to dismiss from ruling that there is no case, where that involves concluding that the only evidence advanced against the accused is plainly inadmissible. An example would be where the only evidence was clearly hearsay. McCracken J acknowledged, in the passage cited, that, if there had been a search without warrant, where one was required, &#8220;certainly the District Judge would have been justified in refusing to send the second respondent forward for trial, as there would have been no evidence to justify the search of his premises&#8230;&#8221; Such a conclusion would necessarily imply a determination that the evidence was inadmissible. This jurisdiction will exist only in the clearest of cases. It does not mean that the first-named respondent, in this case, should have conducted any form of inquiry involving the resolution of disputed issues of fact. Furthermore, he must bear in mind that other evidence given at trial my cast further light on a particular matter. Interpreted in this way, section 4E would not entrench on the unitary nature of a criminal trial. For reasons I have given, it was not the intention of section 4E to confer jurisdiction to determine disputed issues of fact in advance of trial.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">44.	Finally, I wish to add that I do not accept that the interpretation of the section can be in any way influenced by the tactical considerations concerning the stage at which an accused person should plead guilty to a section 15A offence. The courts cannot take into account the risks an accused person runs by failing to enter a plea of guilty while he raises what the appellant&#8217;s submissions describe as a &#8220;technical defence.&#8221; Legislation imposing, in the public interest, a presumed minimum sentence of ten years imprisonment, subject to mitigation in the event of an early plea stands alone. It cannot affect the exercise of the power conferred on the trial court by section 4E or the interpretation of that section. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">45.	I would allow the appeal. I would make an order quashing the decision of the first-named Respondent of 11th May 2004. That will enable the trial court to resume consideration of the Appellant&#8217;s application for dismissal of the charges against him.</font>
