<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Judgment of the Court delivered on the 10th day of March, 2015, by Denham C.J.</font></b>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> 1.	This is an appeal by the applicant/appellant, J.(S).T., hereinafter referred to as &#8220;the appellant&#8221;, from the judgment and order of the High Court (Kearns P.), made and perfected on the 17th January, 2014, refusing to prohibit the trial of the appellant in Limerick Circuit Criminal Court on 251 counts of indecent assault on a number of pupils in a national school in Limerick between 1979 and 1981, when the appellant was a teacher at the school. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2.	The Director of Public Prosecutions is the respondent, and is referred to as &#8220;the D.P.P&#8221;.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3.	This appeal is in essence a repeat of the appellant&#8217;s previous unsuccessful appeal, made in relation to other prosecutions, where other complainants, other ex pupils of his, made similar complaints:  </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">J.T. v. D.P.P.</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">  [2007] IESC 270.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Judicial Review</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">4.	The High Court (Peart J.) on the 30th January 2013, granted the appellant leave to apply for judicial review for the following reliefs:-</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">(i)	An order of prohibition, or in the alternative an injunction, by way of judicial review prohibiting the D.P.P., his servants or agents, from prosecuting criminal proceedings entitled &#8220;The People (at the suit of the D.P.P) &#8211;v- J.(S).T., Bill Number 93/2010&#8221; pending before Limerick Circuit Court and comprising of 113 charges.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii)	An order of prohibition, or in the alternative an injunction, by way of judicial review prohibiting the D.P.P., his servants or agents, from prosecuting criminal proceedings entitled &#8220;The People (at the suit of the D.P.P) &#8211;v- J.(S).T., Bill Number LK 190/12&#8221; pending before Limerick Circuit Court and comprising of 139 charges. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iii)	An order of prohibition by way of judicial review staying the trial of the appellant as an abuse of process.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iv)	A declaration that the delay in instituting the criminal proceedings and the delay in bringing the proceedings to hearing had prejudiced the appellant generally and specifically with regard to the possibility of a fair trial.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(v)	A declaration that the wholly exceptional circumstances exist in the circumstances of this case that render it unfair or unjust to put the appellant on trial.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(vi)	A declaration that the delay in bringing the criminal proceedings the subject matter of the application to hearing constitutes:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">a)	an unfair procedure within the meaning of article 40.3 of the Constitution;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">b)	a trial otherwise than in due course of law as required by Article 38 of the Constitution;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">c)	an infringement of the appellant&#8217;s liberty; and</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">d)	A breach of Article 6 of the European Convention for the Protection of Rights and Fundamental Freedoms 1950.</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(vii)	An order staying the criminal proceedings the subject matter of the application for relief.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(viii)	An order providing for an extension of time within which to bring these proceedings.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ix)	Damages </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(x)	Costs. </font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">5.	The grounds for such relief sought were:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8220;i)	The [appellant] is now seventy years of age and in bad health. He currently faces 251 charges of indecent assault spanning the time period 1979 to 1981 in respect of 18 complainants. Complaints were made by all but one of these complainants upon being approached by members of An Garda Siochana. The first complaint which was made by [R.K.C.] was made in or around 2005 and thereafter members of An Garda Siochana approached the other 17 complainants on dates between 2006 to 2011.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">ii)	These charges are currently pending before Limerick Circuit Court (Bill Number 93/2010) and Bill Number LK190/12.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">iii)	The [appellant] was questioned by the prosecution authorities in respect of the allegations the subject matter of Bill Number 93/2010 in May 2006 and May 2008 and was first before the court on the 11th February 2010 in respect of these allegations. The prosecution authorities made disclosure in November 2012 after a trial date of the 5th of February 2013 had been set. An earlier trial date had been vacated on the application of the prosecution.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">iv)	The [appellant] was first before the court in respect of the allegations the subject matter of Bill Number LK190/12 on the 21st June 2012 having been questioned about these matters by members of An Garda Siochana in 2011. It would seem that these complaints were received from members of An Garda Siochana after the gardai approached former pupils of the Christian Brothers in Sexton Street, Limerick on dates between 2010 and 2011. A book of evidence was served on the [appellant] in respect of these matters on the 28th of November 2012 and he was returned for trial to Limerick Circuit Court on the same day. A provisional trial date of the 5th of February 2013 has also been set for the trial of these matters.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">v)	The [appellant] has previously faced trial on 6 occasions on diverse dates between May 2009 and May 2011 before Dublin Circuit Criminal Court for similar allegations (and been in custody for a total of 4 ½ years on foot of those matters) but has never been convicted of any offence.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">vi)	The delay on the part of the Director of Public Prosecutions in commencing these criminal proceedings (both in terms of complainant delay and prosecutorial delay) constitutes a breach of the [appellant's] constitutional rights:</font>
<ul><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(a) 	to be tried on criminal charges in due course of law pursuant to Article 38.1 of the Constitution.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(b) 	to be tried with reasonable expedition.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(c) 	to fair procedures, and</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(d)	 to fairness and justice</font></ul>
<br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">vii)	The delay on the part of the Director of Public Prosecutions in commencing these proceedings (both in terms of complainant delay and prosecutorial delay):</font>
<ul><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(a) constitutes an inordinate and inexcusable delay, and</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(b) has prejudiced the [appellant]. In this regard the [appellant], at this time remove does not remember individual complainants and one potential witness namely R.C.C. is now deceased. Furthermore, one of the complainants namely R.C.C. refers to making a complaint about me to a Brother Sexton. However at this time remove it is impossible for me to establish that no such complaint was actually made as the then principle of the school is deceased.</font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	The witnesses Sue Davis Dawn Bird and K.M. Noonan cannot be located by the prosecution authorities. All counselling notes made by them have been destroyed. These witnesses are said to have counselled the complainant R.C.C. It is now impossible for the [appellant] to establish what may have been said by the complainant R.C.C. to these witnesses about the subject matter of chafes 1 and 2 in the book of evidence relating to Bill Number 93/2005 and so cross examine as to any previous inconsistent statements.</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">viii)	The delay on the part of the Director of Public Prosecutions in commencing these proceedings (both in terms of complainant delay and prosecutorial delay) is contrary to Article 6 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms 1950.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">ix)	The trial of the [appellant] on these offences at such a remote time from the date of the alleged offences amounts to an abuse of process of the courts. The prosecuting authorities have manipulated the court process so as to cause the [appellant] the maximum amount of stress and anxiety.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">x)	The prosecuting authorities, their servants or agents, by their acts or more particularly by their omissions are culpable in relation to the passage of time between the alleged incidents and the initiation of proceedings.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">xi)	Exceptional circumstances exist that render it unfair or unjust to put the [appellant] on trial. Those circumstances are as follows:</font>
<ul><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8226;	the charges relate to events which are alleged to have occurred 32 to 34 years ago,</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8226;	save for one complainant the gardai seem to have first approached the complainants,</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8226;	the [appellant] is now 70 years of age and in bad health,</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8226;	the [appellant] has previously faced trial on 6 occasions in respect of similar allegations and has not been convicted,</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#8226;	the [appellant] has previously spent over 4 years in custody in while awaiting trial for those other matters;</font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">xii)	Such further or other grounds as this Honourable court may deem meet.&#8221;</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The High Court judgment </font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">6.	The High Court (Kearns P.) by judgment and order on the 17th January, 2014, refused the appellant&#8217;s application.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7.	The learned trial judge held that he was not satisfied that there had been any prosecutorial delay in bringing the prosecutions after the complaints were initially made.  He stated:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">	&#8220;This was not a case which lent itself to a speedy process. The very number of complaints made that impossible.&#8221;  </font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">8.	Kearns P. held that even if there had been undue prosecutorial delay, the appellant&#8217;s application would still have been refused because exceptional circumstances did not exist which would have rendered it unfair or unjust to put the appellant on trial.  The appellant had sought to rely on his advanced age and poor health as constituting exceptional circumstances.  However Kearns P. rejected this and held that the medical evidence before the Court did not suggest that the appellant was incapable of participating in the trial process. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">9.	It was also held by the learned trial judge that the fact the appellant had previously faced trial on six other occasions on other complaints, and had not been convicted, could not be described as exceptional circumstances that would warrant a grant of the relief sought.  Kearns P. stated:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">	&#8220;This Court is of the view that the &#8216;Dublin offences&#8217; or his period of freely chosen time in custody are not matters relevant to the present application. To hold otherwise would ineluctably lead to the position that the longer the list of offences with which a person was charged the less likely it would become that he would ever have to stand trial for those later uncovered and made the subject of further criminal charges.&#8221;</font></ul>
<br>
</ul>
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Notice of appeal</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">10.	The appellant filed a notice of appeal setting out 16 grounds of appeal.  The primary ground of appeal arises from an alleged failure of the learned President of the High Court to conduct an overall assessment of all the circumstances in considering whether it would be unfair or unjust to put the appellant on trial. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> The specific grounds of appeal were stated to be:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &#8220;1. 	The learned President of the High Court erred in law in failing to conduct an overall assessment of all the circumstances of the Appellant and concerning the prosecutions pending against him for the purpose of determining whether the relief sought by the Appellant should be granted, in particular on the ground that it would be unfair or unjust to put the Appellant on trial.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2.	 The learned President of the High Court erred in law in concluding that it would not be unfair or unjust to put the Appellant on trial in this case. In this regard, the teamed President of the High Court Judge failed to have regard to the totality of the circumstances of the case in so concluding.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3.	 The learned President of the High Court erred in law in finding that the Appellant's previous multiple trials for similar type charges, over many years, none of which resulted in a conviction, and time spent in custody by the Appellant while awaiting those trials, were not relevant to the application to prohibit the Appellant's trial on the charges the subject matter of these proceedings.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">4. 	The learned President of the High Court erred in law and in fact in treating the case as one in which an application for leave to bring proceedings by way of judicial review was brought at the last moment only days before the trial was due to get underway, when the reasons for the timing of the application were explained on affidavit. In particular, the learned President of the High Court erred in law in failing to consider or give any or any adequate weight to the circumstances that, in one case (bill no. 190/2012), the application was in fact brought within less than three months of the return for trial and, in the other case (bill no. 93/2010), the application was brought within less than three months of disclosure having been made by the prosecution notwithstanding repeated requests by the defence over a period of two years for disclosure, which requests were deliberately ignored by the prosecution, and in circumstances where the prosecution proposed to have the two cases tried together.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">5.	The learned President of the High Court erred in law in treating the investigation as sufficiently complex and detailed to require five years or more for the prosecution to investigate yet failing to consider or give any or any adequate weight to the circumstances in which the Appellant was required to defend the allegations with less than three months notice of the case against him on bill no. 190/2012 and with less than three months to consider the disclosure made by the prosecution on both bills.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">6. 	The learned President of the High Court erred in law in failing to consider or give any or any adequate weight to the circumstances in which the complaints emerged, in particular that there had been extensive, adverse publicity concerning the Appellant, which publicity had prompted civil actions by some of the complainants, and there was evidence of communication between some of the complainants in that regard, without complaints having been made by-them to the Gardai of any criminal wrongdoing.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7.	The learned President of the High Court erred in law in failing to consider or give any or any adequate weight to the fact that some of the complainants, having pursued civil actions in those circumstances, had not made any complaint of criminal wrongdoing until approached by Gardaí.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">8. 	The learned President of the High Court erred in law in applying the principle identified in S. H. v. Director of Public Prosecutions [2006] 3 I.R. 574, that it is not a necessity to inquire into the reasons for complainant delay, in the particular and very unusual circumstances of this case, in particular the fact that some of the complainants had spoken to other complainants about the subject matter of the charges, having become aware of adverse publicity concerning the Appellant, and had commenced or even concluded civil proceedings without making any complaint to the Gardaí.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">9. 	The learned President of the High Court erred in law and in fact in concluding that no blameworthy prosecutorial delay had occurred.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">10. 	The learned President of the High Court erred in law in failing to consider or give any or any adequate weight to the delay in the conduct of the Garda investigations and in the assessment of the outcome of those investigations by the Second-Named Respondent.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">11. 	The learned President of the High Court erred in law in failing to consider or give any or any adequate weight to the deliberate policy of the prosecution to frustrate the conduct of the defence in relation to bill no. 93/2010 by refusing to make disclosure in relation to that case until such time as they were in a position to proceed with bill no. 190/2012, notwithstanding repeated requests for such disclosure to be made, and notwithstanding the very considerable passage of time since the dates of the alleged offences.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">12. 	The learned President of the High Court erred in law and in fact in concluding that the Appellant was not prejudiced by reason of blameworthy prosecutorial delay.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">13. 	The learned President of the High Court erred in law and in fact in his assessment of the evidential significance of the prejudice to the Applicant as a result of the passage of time, in particular in relation to the loss of counseling notes in relation to one complainant and the death of Brother S and of a teacher, FK.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">14. 	The learned President of the High Court erred in law in deciding that, because it had not been shown that the Appellant was incapable of participating in a trial process, it would therefore not be unfair or unjust to put him on trial.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">15. 	The learned President of the High Court erred in-law and in fact in exercising his discretion to refuse the relief sought on the grounds that the application was brought days before the trial was due to get underway.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">16. 	Such further and other grounds as to this Honourable Court may seem fit.&#8221;</font></ul>
<br>
</ul>
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Submissions on behalf of the appellant </font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">11.	Written and oral submissions were made on behalf of the appellant. It was submitted that there had been blameworthy prosecutorial delay in this case. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">12.	It was submitted that the appellant would suffer specific prejudice if the matter went to trial as his position is fatally hampered by the passage of time and the absence of witnesses. It was submitted that the absence of four witnesses means that they cannot be cross examined as to any previous inconsistent statements made by one of the complainants.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">13.	In oral submissions, counsel for the appellant said that the adverse publicity generated in relation to the alleged Dublin offences, including the appellant&#8217;s identification in media publications, affected the emergence of further allegations in this case. It was submitted that the existence of these newspaper articles and the emergence of civil claims against the appellant undermines the credibility of the complainants and the fairness of the trial. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">14.	Counsel for the appellant submitted that the following cumulative factors give rise to wholly exceptional circumstances so as to render it unfair or unjust to put the appellant on trial in this case:- </font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">(i)	The age (71) and ill-health of the appellant. During the course of these proceedings the appellant&#8217;s health has fallen into significant decline.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(ii)	The charges relate to events which are alleged to have occurred 32 to 34 years ago.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iii)	Save for one complainant the gardaí seem to have first approached all the other complainants</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(iv)	There is evidence that there was discussion amongst some of complainants prior to official complaints being made to the gardaí. Some of those discussions took place in contemplation of civil proceedings. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(v)	The prosecution are unable to locate witnesses, and counselling records have been destroyed. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(vi)	The appellant has previously faced trial on 6 occasions in respect of similar allegations from other complainants, &#8220;the Dublin offences&#8221;, and has not been convicted.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(vii)	The appellant has previously spent over 4 years in custody while awaiting trial for those other matters.</font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Submissions on behalf of the D.P.P.</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">15.	Counsel for the D.P.P. made oral and written submissions to the Court.  It was submitted on behalf of the D.P.P. that a complex and detailed investigation had taken place and there had been no blameworthy prosecutorial delay in the complex circumstances of this case. Further, there was no evidence before the High Court that valuable evidence was lost or that there was any specific prejudice arising from delay in this case.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">16.	In the event that the Court should find that there has been blameworthy prosecutorial delay, it was submitted that this Court, in adopting the balancing exercise, should find that the public interest in having these multiple allegations prosecuted outweighs the effect of any delay in the case. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">17.	The sheer number of allegations and the serious nature of those allegations made against the appellant, from various pupils from various classes at the school, is an important factor that should weigh against prohibition in the event that the Court adopts any such balancing test. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">18.	Counsel for the D.P.P. submitted that the High Court (Kearns P.) addressed each of the issues stated by the appellant to constitute cumulative factors that justified prohibition. He considered the issue of prosecutorial delay, the allegations that this was a garda driven investigation, the issue of unavailable witnesses and whether the Dublin charges should be weighed in the balance. The trial judge then specifically addressed the health of the appellant and concluded that none of the medical evidence suggested that the appellant was unable to stand trial or incapable of participating in the trial process or that his ability to contest the charges would be in any way impaired. </font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Decision</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">19.	This appeal is very similar to an earlier appeal taken by the appellant, J.(S).T before this Court in relation to the alleged Dublin offences, </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">J.T. v. D.P.P</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">. [2007] IESC 270.  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">20.	In </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">J.T. v. D.P.P</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">.  the Court refused the appellant&#8217;s application to injunct his trial and held that he had failed to establish matters so as to invoke the  jurisdiction of the Court upon which to prohibit his trial.  The appellant did not meet the required test for prohibition of a trial, and in the circumstances as a whole there was no real risk of an unfair trial. It was pointed out that the trial would proceed under the control of a judge who had a duty to ensure that the trial was fair.  It was stated:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">	&#8220;On behalf of the applicant it was submitted that the alleged offences occurred many years ago, that the Director of Public Prosecutions decided to prosecute, but that he was guilty of delay in his office, that there was leaking of information by the Garda Síochána, that there was a campaign of vilification, that he says he can remember only four of the complainants, that relevant witnesses have died, that some of the school rolls are missing, and that in all of the circumstances of the case there is a real risk of an unfair trial arising from the cumulative effect.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	I have addressed the factors individually previously in this judgment. Considering them cumulatively I am not satisfied that they meet the required test for intervention and prohibition of a trial by the Court either on the basis of prosecutorial delay, or an abuse of trial process. In the circumstances as a whole there is no real risk of an unfair trial. As in all such cases the trial will proceed under the control of a judge who has the duty to ensure that the trial is fair. The test to be applied is that stated by Finlay C.J. in Z. v. Director of Public Prosecutions[1994] 2 I.R. 476, at p.507:</font>
<ul><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">	&#8216;&#8230; to establish a real risk of an unfair trial &#8230; necessarily and inevitably means an unfair trial which cannot be avoided by appropriate rulings and directions on the part of the trial judge. The risk is a real one but the unfairness of trial must be an unavoidable unfairness of trial.&#8217;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Conclusion</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The applicant has sought to raise the exceptional jurisdiction of the Court to prohibit his trial. However, he has failed to establish matters so as to invoke this jurisdiction. In all the circumstances of the case, which include the fact that there are multiple offences, multiple complaints, and witnesses available to the alleged events, I would dismiss the appeal of the applicant and affirm the order of the High Court refusing the application to injunct the trial.&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">21.	 While this case relates to complaints against the appellant arising from different pupils in another school, the issues are similar.  On analysis of this application, the conclusion is the same.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Prosecutorial delay</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">22.	The appellant raised the issue of prosecutorial delay.  In the case of </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">S. H. v. Director of Public Prosecutions </font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">[2006] 3 I.R. 574, this Court set out the approach to be applied in applications to prohibit criminal trials on grounds of complainant delay.  It was held to be no longer necessary for the Court to inquire into the reasons for the delay or whether the accused had exercised dominion over the complainant or make assumptions as to the truth of the complaints.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">23.	The Court would adopt the reasoning of Kearns J., as he then was, in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">P.M v. Malone</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2002] 2 I.R 560, who set out the required balancing process when considering blameworthy prosecutorial delay. He stated as follows at p. 185 :-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">	&#8220;I believe that the balancing exercise referred to by Keane C.J. in  P.M. v. Malone  [2002] 2 I.R. 560 is the appropriate mechanism to be adopted by a court in determining whether blameworthy prosecutorial delay should result in an order of prohibition. It means that an applicant for such relief must put something more into the balance where prosecutorial delay arises to outweigh the public interest in having serious charges proceed to trial. In most cases, pre-trial incarceration will not be an element as an applicant will probably have obtained bail pending his trial. Secondly, while he may assert increased levels of stress and anxiety arising from prosecutorial delay, any balancing exercise will have to take into account the length of such blameworthy delay, because if it is a short delay rather than one of years, the mere fact that some blameworthy delay took place should not of itself justify the prohibition of a trial.&#8221;</font></ul>
<br>
</ul>
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Prior prosecutions</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">24.	The Court agrees with and affirms the approach of the learned President that, the charges relating to &#8220;Dublin offences&#8221; have no relevance to the allegations that are the subject matter of this complaint. The appellant did spend time in custody but this was because he voluntarily decided not to take up bail.  Again, it is not relevant to these proceedings.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Specific prejudice</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">25.	On behalf of the appellant it was submitted that important witnesses died or cannot be traced.  In particular, the principle of the school at the time, Brother D, to whom complainants said they made complaints, is now deceased.  However, this is not a factor of itself sufficient to prohibit the trial.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">26.	Three individuals who were counsellors and from whom statements were taken are unavailable. Counselling records in relation to one of the complainants, R.K have been destroyed. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">27.	In all the circumstances, the missing records are not a basis upon which to prohibit the trial.  In a recent case of </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Ó&#8217;C. v. D.P.P</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [2014], O&#8217;Malley J. rejected the argument that missing records from a health centre and the death of a doctor, to whom the complainant had spoken to about alleged sexual abuse, were matters which should persuade the Court to grant prohibition.  Each case has to be considered on its own facts.  The alleged absence of documents in this case does not appear to be such upon which to prohibit a trial.  That said, it is an issue which may be opened to the trial judge, who will be best placed to determine the matter.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Cumulative circumstances</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">28.	It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that his age, ill health and inability to withstand stress, </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">inter alia</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">, are factors which render this case such that it warrants an order of prohibition. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">29.	The appellant relied on the case of </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">PT v D.P.P</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">. [2007] IESC 39.  However, each case has to be considered on its own facts.  In </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">PT v D.P.P</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">.  the appellant had a serious medical condition and was much older, 87 years of age.  The Court would distinguish that case. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">30.	Further, in relation to the age and ill health of the appellant, the Court adopts the reasoning in </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">DT v. D.P.P</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana">.. [2007] IESC 2, where it was held:-</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">	&#8220;The issue raised on behalf of the applicant is his alleged disability, his capacity. Such is not part of the jurisprudence on delay and the right to a fair trial, it is not an issue of prejudice caused by delay. Incapacity or disability may arise in situations where there is no delay. If there are issues as to the applicant's capacity there are separate specific procedures to be applied. It is a matter for the trial court to determine a person's fitness to stand trial.  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	[&#8230;]</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	Applying the law to the facts of this case I am satisfied that the issue of the applicant's fitness to plead is a matter for the appropriate law and the trial court and that the applicant's submissions on this ground fail.&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">31.	The Court is satisfied that the medical evidence proffered, in addition to other  factors raised, falls short of that required to prohibit a trial.  While there are a number of factors raised by the appellant, they do not, combined together, establish a situation where his trial should be prohibited.  The Court would dismiss the appeal and affirm the decision of the High Court.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Information in the public domain</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">32.	There is a matter of concern in this appeal. It appears that there may have been a leaking of information by a member or members of An Garda Siochána. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">33.	 This issue was considered by High Court (Hanna J.) in the earlier case concerning &#8220;the Dublin offences&#8221; J.T. v D.P.P [2007] IEHC 309.  Hanna J. found that the leakage did not require prohibition, but stated:- </font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="2" face="Verdana">	&quot;Having heard his evidence and observed him I am not disposed to conclude that Detective Garda Maloney was personally responsible for passing information of the calibre complained of to the print media. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	Nonetheless, I am satisfied that some part of it at least was sourced from a member or members of An Garda Síochána. It is unfortunate that I must come to this conclusion given the limited nature of the enquiry in which I have engaged. It is to my mind most regrettable that, after all of these articles had appeared, including material about which Detective Garda Maloney expressed grave reservations, only the most lacklustre and informal enquiry resulted. Given the possibility of the derailment of a trial I cannot accept that this was an appropriate response to what was, potentially, a significant disciplinary matter.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	[&#8230;]</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	In the circumstances of this case I am not persuaded that the leaking of information to the press by a member or members of An Garda Síochána constitutes sufficient reason for stopping the trial. What occurred was reprehensible. But, although undoubtedly sustained by the feeding of information to the newspapers, it is possible that the graphic and, at times, tasteless and abusive references to the applicant may have occurred in any event.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">	Further, the evidence before me indicates that any vilification referable to the leaks ceased over three years ago. Any residual trial prejudice could be assessed and dealt with if appropriate by the trial judge.&#8221;</font></ul>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">34.	The Court agrees with Hanna J..  While this is a matter for concern,  it is not a ground upon which to prohibit the trial of the appellant in the circumstances of this case at this time.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">35.	On the issue of prejudicial publicity, in this case, because of the lapse of time, the fade factor applies, and it is not a basis upon which to prohibit the trial.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">36.	The Court, however, is concerned at the apparent premeditated leaking of information by a member or members of An Garda Síochána.  The Court condemns any such action by a member of An Garda Síochána.  It should be observed also, that any such action in another case could have the most serious consequences.  The Court welcomes the opportunity to address this issue in a case where, for quite different reasons, it is not appropriate to prohibit the trial.  It must be clearly understood that information about a criminal investigation in the possession of a member of An Garda Síochána, is not his or her personal property to be shared, or otherwise disposed of, at his or her personal discretion.  It is Official information, in the possession of An Garda Síochána as a State Institution.  If the gardai </font><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">as an Institution</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> decide to publicise such information to the Media, on the authority of a senior officer, that is quite a different matter.  But unauthorised leaks by individual members do no credit to the force and may, in an appropriate case, lead to the prohibition of a trial. It is for those in charge of An Garda Síochána to bring this practice to an end, whether it is attributable to &#8216;Garda sources&#8217; or to an individual member.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">37.	The Court contrasts what happened in this case with a situation where it may be appropriate for An Garda Síochána as an institution, with proper authority from a senior officer, perhaps through the Garda Press Office, to seek publicity in a case to, for example, bring forward witnesses, or for another good reason.</font><br>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Conclusion</font></b><br>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">38.	For the reasons given, the Court would affirm the order of the learned High Court President and dismiss the appeal.</font>
