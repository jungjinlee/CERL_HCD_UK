<b><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Judgment delivered by Macken, J. on the 30th day of July 2009.</font></u></b><br>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	This is an appeal from a judgment of the High Court (Laffoy, J.) delivered on the 11th May 2006 and the order dismissing the plaintiff&#8217;s claim made on the 23rd May 2006.  It concerns the correct interpretation of the Dublin Cemeteries Committee Act 1970 (&#8220;the Act of 1970&#8221;) a private Act by which the first defendant (&#8220;the committee&#8221;) was established, which committee replaced a body corporate, Dublin Cemeteries Committee (&#8220;the 1846 committee&#8221;), established under the Cemeteries Act 1846, in turn described as a public Act.  The committee is a registered charity for tax purposes and has incorporated the second and third named defendants which are limited liability companies.  The committee owns and manages several cemeteries in Dublin City and County, including Goldenbridge Cemetery, Glasnevin Cemetery, Palmerstown Cemetery, Dardistown Cemetery and Newlands Cross Cemetery.  Goldenbridge cemetery (which is now full) and Glasnevin Cemetery already existed at the time of the passing of the 1846 Act and the creation of the 1846 committee, whereas the last three named cemeteries were established between 1978 and 1999 to serve the much larger population of Dublin.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The plaintiff has been engaged in business since 1988.  This business involves the design, construction and sale of headstones and monumental sculpting, also in the Dublin area, which was originally conducted in partnership with his brother but in 1999 the first plaintiff acquired his brother&#8217;s interest in the business.  It has been carried on from the beginning from Swords in County Dublin and the plaintiff&#8217;s business services cemeteries in the City and County of Dublin which would ordinarily include all of the cemeteries owned and managed by the committee.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	In the High Court proceedings the plaintiff alleges that the manner in which the second defendant (&#8220;the company&#8221;) carries on its business is unfair to him and to other persons who operate both monumental sculpting businesses and provide headstones, and is damaging to such businesses.  Before the plaintiff commenced these proceedings he raised these issues with politicians, the Revenue Commissioners with the Competition Authority, but without any successful outcome.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	As was stated by the learned High Court judge, the nub of the plaintiff&#8217;s complaint is that the Act of 1970 does not empower the committee, or any company operating under the control of the committee such as the company or the third defendant (I deal with both together in this judgment) to sell on a commercial basis,  monuments or headstones or to provide inscription services or similar products or services and that its activities, whether operated by the committee itself, or through the medium of the company, are </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">ultra vires </font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">the Act of 1970</font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">.</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">  The plaintiff sought declarations that neither the committee nor the company was entitled to engage in the commercial sale of headstones, nor entitled to prohibit the engagement of monumental sculptors, such as the plaintiff, for the purposes of placing inscriptions on headstones, </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">inter alia</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">, in the Garden of Remembrance at Glasnevin cemetery.  The plaintiff also sought injunctions to prevent or prohibit the committee engaging in any such activity, and damages for breach of his constitutional right to earn a livelihood.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	It was accepted by the committee that if it was not entitled to engage in the activities which the plaintiff contended were </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">ultra vires </font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">its powers, then any company owned or controlled by the committee such as the company, could not either engage in such activities.  The core issue in the case in the High Court was whether the activities, as contended by for the plaintiff, were </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">ultra vires </font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">the powers of the committee under the Act of 1970.  It follows therefore that if they were, the company established by the committee and under its control, cannot carry on the same activities.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	In an earlier decision delivered on the 28th day of May on the question whether the plaintiff had </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">locus standi</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> to bring the proceedings, I found that the respondents could not succeed by virtue of the provision of the Competition Act 1991 in preventing the plaintiff from seeking the relief which he claims in these proceedings.</font><br>
<u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The background: the legislation</font></u><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The Act of 1846 included in its preamble that the committee for the management of Goldenbridge and Glasnevin cemeteries had existed prior to the enactment of that Act but that its members had either died or had declined to act.  Certain named persons and other persons who might be nominated and elected to fill vacancies were constituted the 1846 committee and they were granted power by the legislation, inter alia, to hold Goldenbridge and Prospect cemeteries.  Further the Act of 1846 provided that it would be lawful for the 1846 committee subject to such conditions as they might think proper, to sell &#8211; </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">1	the exclusive right of burial in any vault catacomb or place of burial constructed by them within the cemeteries </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">2	the right of constructing any vault catacomb or place of burial within any such cemetery with exclusive right of burial therein</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">3	the right of single internment in any vault catacomb or other place of burial constructed within the cemeteries or in the open ground thereof</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">4	the right of erecting and placing any monument tombstone or gravestone in the cemeteries or any monument or monumental inscription on the walls of the chapels or other places within the cemeteries.</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul></ul>
</ul>

<ul><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	It was also provided by the Act of 1846 that internments vaults catacombs burial places monuments tombstones and gravestones in the cemeteries would be subject to such regulation restrictions and conditions as the 1846 committee established under that Act, should from time to time make.  Further it was expressly provided that monumental inscriptions should be approved by the 1846 committee before being inscribed.  The committee was also given power to enforce its regulations restrictions and conditions by being empowered by erasing or removing  an unauthorised inscription and by taking down and removing any unauthorised monument, tombstone and such like.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Turning to the Act of 1970, this was described as an Act &#8220;to establish a body corporate to undertake and carry out the functions at present undertaken and carried out by the &#8216;Dublin Cemeteries Committee&#8217; and &#8220;to enlarge and extend such functions&#8221;.  The preamble also recited the Act of 1846, the acquisition by the 1846 committee of further lands in the parish of Glasnevin, and to avid doubts which had arisen in relation to the nature and constitution of the 1846 committee and as to its power to acquire and provide burial facilities in the county and county borough of Dublin elsewhere than in the parish of Glasnevin aforesaid to sell or dispose of land, and to invest or deal with surplus monies.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The committee was established by s.3 as &#8220;a body corporate with perpetual succession and an official seal &#8230; and power to sue and be sued in its said name and to purchase, take, hold, and dispose of land and </font><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">other property&#8221;</font></u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">.  Members of the 1846 committee were to be members of the committee established under the Act of 1970, and subject to certain exceptions were to hold office for life.  Further the committee was to be self perpetuating subject to an upper limit on membership.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Of particular importance in relation to this case are the provisions of s.16 and also s.17 of the Act of 1970 which respectively provide as follows:</font>
<p><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	&#8220;16  The objects for which the Committee is established are as follows:</font></i>
<p><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">		( a ) To maintain, improve and extend the existing Cemeteries and to 		preserve the bodies interred in them from disturbance and desecration.		( b ) To acquire, provide, maintain, improve, lay-out, construct and 		operate in the County and County Borough of Dublin cemeteries, 			burial grounds and other places and means for the burial, interment, 		preservation or disposal of human remains in accordance with the 			rites, services and beliefs of any of the religious denominations 			specified in Article 44 of Bunreacht na h…ireann or of any other 			religious denomination existing in the Republic of Ireland on the 			establishment date.</font></i>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">17	Subject to the provisions of this Act, the Committee shall have, in addition to any other powers vested in or conferred on it by any other provision of this Act power:-</font></i>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(a) to purchase, take on lease or otherwise acquire any lands &#8230;</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(b) to sell, improve, manage, develop, exchange, lease, hire, mortgage, dispose, turn into account or otherwise deal with all or any part of the undertaking property and rights of the Committee.</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(c) to borrow &#8230;</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(d) to invest &#8230;</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(e) to employ &#8230;</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(f) to accept &#8230; grants, subscriptions, donations, devises, and bequests for all or any of the purposes of the Committee and generally to manage, invest and expend all moneys or property belonging to the Committee.</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(g) &#8230;</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(h) &#8230;</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(i) to build, construct, erect, improve and maintain buildings, chapels, monuments, headstones and structures for use or decoration in or in connection with cemeteries or burial grounds.</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(j) To bury &#8230;</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(k) To do all such other things as the Committee may consider incidental or conducive to the attainment or advancement of any of the objects of the Committee.&#8221;</font></i></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Of relevance in this appeal are the provisions of s.17(i) and (k).   The former provides for a power to build construct erect, </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">inter alia</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">, headstones and structures for use or decoration in or in connection with cemeteries or burial grounds, and (k) gives all appropriate ancillary powers or powers incidental or conducive to the attainment of any of the objects of the committee.  It does not seem to me that it is necessary to refer to other sections of the Act save to say that all of the functions of the committee can be performed to any of the members or employees of the committee authorised in that behalf.  </font><br>
<u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The judgment:</font></u><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Having dealt with the question of </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">locus standi</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">, in favour of the appellants, the learned High Court judge then considered the claim that the activities being carried on by the committee through the company were </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">ultra vires</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> the powers of the committee under the Act of 1970.  I now turn to the learned judge&#8217;s findings.  In light of my agreement with the findings of the learned High Court judge and her conclusions, it is useful to set out the most relevant parts of the judgment at this stage.  Having referred in particular to </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Keane v An BÛrd Plean·la</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> [1997] 1 IR 184 the learned trial judge cited as a correct statement of the law the following extract of Hamilton, C.J. in that case:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	</font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;The powers of a corporation created by a statute are limited and circumscribed by the statute which regulate it, and extend no further than is expressly stated therein or is necessarily and properly required for carrying into effect the purposes of incorporation or maybe fairly regarded as incidental to or consequential upon those things which the legislature has authorised.  What the statute does not expressly or impliedly authorise is to be taken to be prohibited.&#8221;</font></i></ul>
</ul>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	She also adopted the extracts from the judgment of Hamilton, C.J. in </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Howard v Commissioners of Public Works</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> [1994] 1 IR 101 at p.112 in the following terms:</font>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	&#8220;It has long been established that the general principle of the construction of the powers of statutory corporations that whatever may be regarded as incidental to, or consequential upon, those things which the legislator has authorised, ought not (unless expressly prohibited) to be held by judicial construction to be ultra vires (Attorney General v Great Eastern Railway Company [1885] App. Cas. 473 at 478).&#8221;</font></i><br>
</ul>
</ul>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Both extracts have been cited with approval in several judgments of this Court, and represent, at this stage, correct law.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The learned High Court judge pointed out that the corporations involved in the latter two cases were both public bodies, but noted correctly in my view, that in the case of statutory corporations established by Private Act of parliament the normal canons of construction applicable to the ascertainment of the powers of statutory corporation, must be applied having regard to the special rules of construction which have evolved in relation to such Acts.  In that regard she cited extracts or commentaries from academic writings including Collins and O&#8217;Reilly on </font><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Civil Proceedings and the State </font></u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(2nd edition Thomson Roundhall, 2004) and Bennion on </font><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Statutory Interpretation</font></u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> in the latter of which is found the following citation:</font>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	&#8220;There are special criteria for the construction of private Acts. These arise because a private Act is essentially a derogation, for the benefit of a few, from the law generally applying. Some private Acts notably estate Acts, are little more than conveyances of land. The &#8216;little more&#8217; amounts to something which the law precluded the parties from doing for themselves, hence they resort to private Bill procedure. &#8230; It follows that estate Acts, which are still passed today, are to be construed more as private conveyances than statutes. &#8230; 	</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	It has been said of private Acts generally that their wording &#8216;is to be treated as the language of the promoters of them&#8217;. The Act is framed by the very persons who desire that the general law shall be eased in their private favour. So where there is any doubt its language is to be construed against them. The rule is verba cartarum fortius accipiuntur contra proferentem (the words of written instruments are to be taken most strongly against those who put them forward).&#8221;</font></i><br>

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The learned trial judge also referred to a more recent application of the strict approach to construction of a Private Act found in the decision of the Court of Appeal (Civil Division) of England and Wales in </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Corporation of London v The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and Covent Garden Market </font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">[2004] EWCA Civ. 1765.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The appellants had submitted that the question for the court was whether the Act of 1970, properly construed, gave the committee power to sell headstones on a commercial basis, to which the respondents replied that the power to manufacture headstones could not have been contemplated unless there was an entitlement to receive payment for the headstones it erected.  The appellants accepted that s.17 paragraph  (i) of the Act of 1970 contained an express power to manufacturer headstones, but argued that this was an innovation and that the 1846 committee did not have express power to do so under the 1846 Act.  Because of the innovation in the Act of 1970, however, they argued that paragraph (i) could not lawfully confer an express power to manufacture headstones for sale.  Therefore, it was said, it was necessary to consider three questions, that is, whether the power to sell headstones (1) is expressly conferred by some other provision, or (2) is an incidental power, or (3) can be implied applying the normal canons of construction.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	 In relation to the first question the appellants submitted that paragraph (b) does not empower the committee to sell a headstone manufactured by the committee under paragraph (i), because, it was said, the context of paragraph 17(b) suggests that it is essentially a power to deal with lands owned by the committee.  The learned High Court judge did not accept that argument but found that under paragraph 17(b) the committee has power to sell &#8220;any property&#8221; , whether it is office equipment or a lawnmower, or, subject to compliance with s.18, land.  The actions enumerated in paragraph (b) she found, do not relate exclusively to land.  Leases and mortgages of chattels are a common phenomenon, whereas the use of the word &#8220;hire&#8221; is not a concept which applies in relation to land.  The appellants had argued that the words &#8220;undertaking property&#8221; meant property properly held for the purposes of the undertaking, leading to the conclusion that under paragraph 17(i) the committee had power to manufacture headstones only for the purposes of maintaining a cemetery and not for the purposes of sale.  It was suggested that this interpretation was borne out by the legislative history and the preamble to the Act of 1970 indicating that the legislative intent was to clarify existing powers but not to extend them.  It was accepted however that in the event of any inconsistency between the operative part of the Act of 1970 and its long title or preamble, the operative part must prevail.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The learned High Court judge found that the appellant&#8217;s approach to the interpretation of s.17 required a reading into that section of something which is not there.  The intention of the legislature she found in enacting paragraph (i) was clear, namely an intention to vest in the committee a power to construct or manufacture specified items, including headstones, and also power to manufacture other structures, but with an express restriction in that such other structures must be for the use or decoration in or in connection with cemeteries or burial grounds.  Because of that restriction the committee does not have power to manufacture, say, garden gnomes.  The learned High Court judge found that there was no other restriction in paragraph 17(i) and she could see no basis for reading into it a condition or proviso limiting the power to manufacture headstones solely for the purposes of maintaining the cemeteries.  Further she found that there was no basis for reading into paragraph 17(b) any limitation on the committee&#8217;s power of sale, other than the limitations stipulated in s.18 in relation to land.  Nothing else in the Act of 1970 necessitated the implication of any limitation in s.17 paragraph (b) or paragraph (i) to avoid inconsistency.  The learned trial judge clarified that in the plain words of s.17 the committee has power to manufacture headstones, and that any headstones it manufactures thereupon becomes &#8220;undertaking property&#8221;.  It is entitled to sell any headstones so manufactured by virtue of paragraph (b).  That interpretation is not so wide as to authorise the committee to do anything, as the plaintiff had suggested.  The defendant does not have power to manufacture items extraneous to their powers, such as garden gnomes, nor power to sell any such items. </font><br>
<u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The appeal:</font></u><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	In this appeal the appellants contend, in essence, that the learned trial judge erred in law in her interpretation of s.17 of the Act, in particular s.17(b) and in (i) of the Act and further erred in finding on her interpretation that they conferred a power on the committee to manufacture and sell headstones on a commercial basis.   In particular the appellants allege that this interpretation:</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">1.	Failed to take adequate account of the first sentence of s.17 of the Act that the powers referred to were &#8220;subject to the provisions of the Act&#8221;</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">2.	Failed adequately to take account of the final sentence of s.17(i) that the power to &#8220;construct&#8221; inter alia headstones was &#8220;for use or in decoration in or in connection with cemeteries or burial grounds&#8221;.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">3.	Erroneously interpreted the power in s.17(i) to &#8220;construct&#8221; as a  power to manufacture on a commercial basis.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">4.	Erroneously equated the bare power to &#8220;sell&#8221; property in the possession of the first named defendant, with a power to enter into the business of the commercial sale thereof.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">5.	Incorrectly expanded the power in s.17(b) to &#8220;deal with undertaking property&#8221; and to &#8220;construct&#8221; inter alia headstones so as to confer upon the first named defendant a power which went beyond its expressly limited statutory objectives under s.16.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">6.	Failed to have adequate count of the objects of the first named defendant provided for in s.16.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">7.	Failed to take adequate account of the provisions of the Act as a whole.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">8.	Interpreted the provisions of s.17(b) and (i) out of their proper context and legislative intent and finally</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">9.	Misunderstood the provisions of the sections relied on to such an extent that the construction placed upon the sections by the learned trial judge to construct and sell commercially headstones could have permitted it to become a seller of lawnmowers or office equipment or to commence business or even to become a property developer.</font>
<ul>
<ul></ul>
</ul>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The appellants cited several other grounds of appeal, but in the oral argument before this court, the central case made on behalf of the appellants was that the learned trial judge had misconstrued the provisions of the Act of 1970 in particular in relation to the power to construct manufacture and sell headstones.  While I sympathise with the plaintiff&#8217;s failure to persuade the Competition Authority to carry out any investigation as a result of the complaint which he made to that Authority some time ago the only issue for consideration in this appeal turns on the question of whether the power which the Committee claims to have to construct and sell headstones, is ultra vires the Act of 1970, and I now turn to the submissions made on behalf of the parties on that issue.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Mr Hogan, senior counsel for the appellants, and Mr Allen, senior counsel on behalf of the respondents, were in substantial agreement as to the tests to be applied in the interpretation of such Private Acts were content to rely effectively on the same case law in that regard, which was also relied upon by the learned High Court judge.  Mr. Allen on behalf of the respondents did suggest that the more recent English case law suggests a more fluid and less rigid approach.  I do not consider it necessary to analyse that more recent case law, as I consider the approach of the learned High Court judge, on her analysis of the law, correct.  Nor were counsel for each of the parties in disagreement with the appropriate extracts from Bennion on </font><u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Statutory Interpretation</font></u><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> which ought to be applied or with the general approach which should be adopted in relation to the issue of statutory interpretation of a private Act insofar as objects and powers are concerned.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	In reality where the parties disagree is in their acceptance or rejection of the analysis carried out by the learned High Court judge of the particular statutory provisions found in the Act of 1970 and in particular on her interpretation of s.17(b) and (i), in the light of the object clause found in s.16, and the provisions of the Act of 1846. . </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The objects provided for in s.16 of the Act of 1970 are clear and have been set out above in that part of the judgment relating to the legislative framework.  The powers of the committee flowing from those objects are equally clearly set out in s.17 of the Act of 1970.  It seems to me that no limitation whatsoever is to be found in s.17 of the Act of 1970 which for convenience is, in its relevant part, in the following terms:</font>
<ul>
<ul><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&#8220;</font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">17	Subject to the provisions of this Act, the Committee shall have, in addition to any other powers vested in or conferred on it by any other provision of this Act power:-</font></i>
<ul>
<ul><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(a) &#8230;</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(b) to sell, improve, manage, develop, exchange, lease, hire, mortgage, dispose, turn into account or otherwise deal with all or any part of the undertaking property and rights of the Committee.</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(c) &#8230;</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(d) &#8230;</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(e) &#8230;</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(f) &#8230;</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(g) &#8230;</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(h) &#8230;</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(i) to build, construct, erect, improve and maintain buildings, chapels, monuments, headstones and structures for use or decoration in or in connection with cemeteries or burial grounds.</font></i><br>
<i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">(k) to do all such other things as the Committee may consider incidental or conducive to the attainment or advancement of any of the objects of the Committee&#8221;</font></i></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	The committee contends in this appeal it has an express power by s.16, to &#8220;construct and operate&#8221; cemeteries in the County and County Borough of Dublin and a specific power under s.17(i) to &#8220;build, construct, erect, improve and maintain &#8230; monuments, headstones and structures &#8230; in connection with cemeteries &#8230;&#8221;.  This is correct, on the clear wording of the provision.  The provisions of s.16 in respect of which the power contained in s.17, including s.17(b) and s.17(i) are granted, appear to me to be adequately broad to include all the powers contended for on behalf of the respondents.  Nor is there any ambiguity in the wording used in s.17(i) which would require or would have required the learned High Court judge to adopt a different and more restricted approach to the one adopted. The learned High Court judge, correctly in my view, also drew specific attention to the fact that, tellingly, the power to sell land is subject to certain restrictions in s.18 of the Act of 1970, whereas in relation to the powers found in s. 17 in respect of other property, no restrictions or conditions are imposed.  It might be thought normal that if any such restriction or condition was to be imposed, it would be found in the terms of the legislation. </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">I agree with the respondent&#8217;s fairly simple contention that if there is a power to construct monuments or tombstones it is tautologous to suggest that these cannot be done on a commercial basis, given that the construction or manufacture is for the purpose of sale, and such power of sale is found in paragraph 17(b).  I accept also the learned trial judge&#8217;s interpretation of the various words used in the latter paragraph, and their application respectively to chattels on the one hand, and to land on the other, and with the conclusion she drew from this interpretation.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	It is also argued on appeal that, in line with the case law on interpreting such Private Acts in a strict and even limited manner, since there was no right to construct monuments in the Act of 1846, there could be no legitimate right to do so pursuant to the Act of 1970, and the Act should be interpreted as meaning that any monuments if constructed could only be for maintenance or remedial works within the cemeteries.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">I do not accept that this is a legitimate argument in the context of the present case. Under the act of 1846, there was a clear right to construct vaults, and such like, for example, as well as a right to control the erection of monuments and of inscriptions, and to remove both.  The purpose of the Act of 1970 is, </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">inter alia</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">, to provide for an extension of the functions previously vesting in the 1846 Committee.  I consider that the powers provided for in the Act of 1970, can readily be included in the phrase &#8221;an extension of the functions&#8221;, of the Committee, if it were necessary to do so.  The power to sell as well as to construct monuments, following on from the power to construct, for example, vaults, is clearly within &#8220;an extension of the functions&#8221; while at the same time being wholly related to the objects clause in s.16 of the Act of 1970, which include as an object the acquisition construction and operation of cemeteries and other burial grounds.  On this ground also, I find myself in agreement with the arguments of the Committee that the power it contends for is properly permitted by the terms of the Act of 1970.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">I am satisfied that the learned High Court judge correctly analysed the position in law, properly interpreted the provisions of the Act of 1970, in particular the relevant provisions relating to objects and powers, and came to a correct view that the powers vesting in the first named respondent included a power to construct headstones and sell on a commercial basis.</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	Provided therefore that the respondents are carrying on the activities complained of, as I find they are, within the powers and objects of the Act, the plaintiff cannot succeed in this appeal.  For the purposes of the claim made in these proceedings, which is limited strictly to whether or not the committee have, by carrying on the business of the manufacture and sale of headstones through the company, acted </font><i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">ultra vires</font></i><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> its powers, I am satisfied it has not.  </font><br>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">	I would in the circumstances dismiss the appeal and affirm the order of the High Court. </font><br>
